/**
 * The `polyfills.ts` file is a TypeScript file that includes polyfills required by the application. A "polyfill" is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
 * For example, if you are using some ES6 features in your TypeScript code that are not supported in some older browsers, like Internet Explorer, you can import polyfills for these features in the `polyfills.ts` file. These polyfills would emulate the expected functionality.
 * In the context of Angular, for instance, the `polyfills.ts` file is very important because Angular is built on the latest standards of the web platform. Targeting such a wide range of browsers is challenging because not all browsers support all features of modern browsers. This is where polyfills come in.
 * However, this could apply to other frameworks or plain TypeScript or JavaScript applications.
 *
 *
 * The given `polyfills.ts` TypeScript snippet is checking to see if the `window` object exists in the globals and if it doesn't exist, the `window` object is assigned to the `globalThis` object.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * if (!globalThis.window) {
 *     globalThis.window = globalThis as typeof window;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here's the walkthrough for the code:
 *
 * - `globalThis` is a standard built-in object, available in all parts of the code. It is largely used to access global scope on both client and server-side JavaScript.
 *
 * - `if (!globalThis.window)` checks if the `window` property exists on `globalThis`. If it doesn't exist, the expression will evaluate to `true`.
 *
 * - `globalThis.window = globalThis as typeof window;` assigns `globalThis` to `window`. It utilizes TypeScript's `as` keyword to assert that `globalThis` is of type `window`.
 *
 * This code is typical in Node.js applications that are incorporating code originally written for the browser, where `window` object is usually utilized as the global object. Since `window` doesn't naturally exist in a Node.js environment, this snippet provides a workaround by mapping it to `globalThis`.
