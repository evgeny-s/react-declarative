# HOF

> accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function

## afterinit

a function `afterinit` which creates a wrapped function around the provided `run` function. 

Let's break down this function further.

The `afterinit` function takes in a single argument `run`. `run` is a function which takes in multiple arguments of type `P` and returns a `Promise<T>`. The `run` function is the function you want to be "wrappable" and which will be executed after the initial call is made.

The `afterinit` function returns an object of type `IWrappedFn<T, P>`. `IWrappedFn<T, P>` is an interface that requires any object to have two parts: a function that takes in arguments of type `P` and returns a `Promise<T>`, and a `clear` function that returns `void`.

The bulk of `afterinit` acts as a stateful wrapper for your `run` function. When you first call the returned function (`wrappedFn`), it simply resolves a `Promise` and sets a `hasComplete` flag to prevent this behavior from happening again unless clear method is called. Any subsequent calls will execute the provided `run` function with the same arguments you gave to the wrapped function.

The `clear` function will reset `hasComplete` to false, indicating that the initial call has not been completed, and allowing the `run` function to be called again when you call `wrappedFn`.

That's the idea: the exported `afterinit` function allows you to treat a function as having a "post-initialization" state, where the function does something different after the first call, and until you reset it with `wrappedFn.clear()`.

This could possibly be useful for use cases like API calls or access to some resources which need an initial setup before they can be used. 

The generics `T` and `P` in the code are mentioned to support type inference across the use of this function. The former `T` stands for the type of value that the Promise resolves to and the latter `P` stands for the parameter list for the function `run`.


## cached

 function `cached` serves as a higher-order function (HOF) that creates a cached version of the provided function, `run`. The caching in this context means that if the function `run` is called with the same arguments as previously, instead of running the whole function again, the previous result is returned, improving performance. This caching behavior is controlled by another function `changed` which checks if the provided arguments have changed compared to last time.

The HOF `cached` is quite abstracted, offering flexibility in usage. It utilizes TypeScript's generics to infer the function's return type (`T`) and argument types (`A`). 

The function begins by defining some variables to store the last arguments `lastArgs`, a flag indicating whether it is the function's first run `initial`, and the last value `lastValue`.

The `clear` function is meant to reset the cache by nullifying `lastArgs`, erasing the cached argument.

The function `executeFn` is the function that is actually run when the cached function is called. It checks if the arguments changed since the last call, using the `changed` function. If `initial` is false and the `changed` function returns false, that means the arguments didn't change, and this function will return the cached `lastValue`. If the arguments have changed or it is the first run, `lastArgs` get updated with the new arguments and `lastValue` will be updated by running the `run` function with the new arguments. 

The `executeFn` is then adorned with the `clear` function and returned as the result of `cached`. This returned function behaves just like the original `run` function in terms of API (because of TypeScript type intersection), but internally uses caching for performance improvement and exposes `clear` to allow manual clearing of cache when needed.

The following auxiliary code, from `makeItemList`, `makeTr`, and `ConditionLayout` show example uses of this HOF. In `ConditionLayout`, the function `shouldCondition`, which determines when condition re-evaluation should occur, is wrapped with our caching mechanism, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary function calls.

Here is how you use `cached` HOF:

```typescript
const cachedFunction = cached(
  (prevArgs, currArgs) => prevArgs[0] !== currArgs[0], // Check for argument changes
  (arg1, arg2) => arg1 + arg2, // Function to be cached
); 

console.log(cachedFunction(1, 2)); // Calls (1 + 2) and returns 3
console.log(cachedFunction(1, 2)); // Since arguments didn't change, returns the cached 3 without re-evaluating

```

When the JSX Components `makeItemList` and `makeTr` are evaluated, they return a cached version of the respective functions `itemList` and `tr`. This cached function will be re-evaluated only when the `prevArgs` and `currentArgs` satisfy the `shouldUpdateItemList` or `shouldUpdateTr` conditions. The `cached` function dramatically improves the performance by avoiding unnecessary reevaluations.

## cancelable

a higher-order function called `cancelable` that takes a function `promise`, which returns a Promise of type `T` and arguments of type `P[]`, and returns a wrapped version of this function with additional capability to cancel the promise.

Here's a breakdown:

- `export const cancelable = <T extends any = any, P extends any[] = any[]>(promise: (...args: P) => Promise<T>): IWrappedFn<T, P> => { /* ... */ };`
  - This is the function declaration for `cancelable`. `T` and `P[]` are generic parameters. `T` must extend `any` and `P[]` must also extend `any[]`.

Inside `cancelable` function:

- It declares a variable `cancelRef`, to hold a reference to the cancellation function. It can then use this reference to cancel previous promises before a new one is created every time `wrappedFn` is called. 
- It defines a function `wrappedFn` that accepts arguments of type `P[]` and returns a new `Promise`.
  - Within this `Promise`, it introduces a flag `hasCanceled` to keep track if a cancellation has been requested.
  - If there already exists a `cancelRef`, that means a previous promise is still pending, so it executes `cancelRef()` to abort that.
  - It then replaces the old `cancelRef` with a new cancellation function. If this is called before promise resolves, `hasCanceled` is set to `true` and it resolves the promise with the `CANCELED_SYMBOL`.
  - It then proceeds to execute the original `promise` function with the provided arguments.
    - If the promise resolves successfully and `hasCanceled` is `false`, it resolves the promise with the value `val`
    - If promise rejects and `hasCanceled` is `false`, it rejects the promise with the `error`
- The `wrappedFn` function also has a `cancel` method attached to it that, when called, will cancel the last promise that `wrappedFn` was trying to resolve.

As for the `IWrappedFn` interface, it describes a function that takes parameters of type `P[]` and returns a `Promise` that resolves to either `T` or `CANCELED_SYMBOL`. It also has a `cancel` method.

Finally, `CANCELED_SYMBOL` is just a unique symbol used specifically to signify that a promise was canceled. This is useful for consumers of `cancelable` to check whether a promise was canceled or it completed normally.


## debounce

 This function is used to limit the rate at which a function can fire. The `debounce` function returns a wrapped version of the passed-in function that delays subsequent invocations until a specified delay has passed. 

Here's a breakdown:

- **Type Parameters**: The `debounce` function uses a single type parameter `T` that extends to a function with any number of arguments and any return type, represented as `(...args: any[]) => any`.

- **Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters:

    - `run` - The function to debounce.
    - `delay` (optional) - The delay in milliseconds before executing the debounced function. It uses the default value of 1,000 milliseconds (or 1 second). 

- **Return Types**: The function returns an intersection type of `T & IClearable`. `T` is the type of the original function, and `IClearable` is an interface that includes methods `clear` and `flush`.

- Inside the `debounce` function, it uses the `timeout` and `lastRun` variables to add the debouncing capability to the `run` function. This is achieved via `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` calls.

    - `wrappedFn`: This function clears the previous timeout, if any, and schedules a new execution of the `run` function after the specified delay. If `wrappedFn` is called again before the delay expires, it will reset the delay.
    - `wrappedFn.clear`: This method cancels any pending invocations of the `run` function.
    - `wrappedFn.flush`: This method executes the `run` function immediately if it's pending execution, and cancels the delay.

The `IClearable` interface is used to augment the returned function with additional methods `clear` and `flush` which operate on the state of the debounced function.


## lock

 a function named `lock` that acts as a utility for wrapping a given promise function with lock functionality.

The `lock` function is a function that accepts a promise as an argument and returns a wrapped function with additional lock/unlock methods. The additional functionality allows for primitive synchronization around the async function calls. That is, it ensures that the wrapped promise function cannot be called while a previous call is still being processed.

Here's how it works:

- `locksubject` is a BehaviorSubject which is a special type of Subject from the RxJS library that holds the state of the lock (locked or not). Whenever it's changed, observers are notified.

- `waitForUnlock()` function creates a Promise that resolves when the lock is released (i.e., 'lockCount' is zero).

- `executeFn` function waits for lock to be released before executing the wrapped promise function.

- `wrappedFn` function executes the wrapped promise function. It also has additional methods 'clear', 'cancel', 'beginLock' and 'endLock' which respectively: clear the lock counter, cancel the execution of the wrapped promise function, increment lock counter and release the lock.

This code comes with the added advantage of centralizing and abstracting the complexity of managing atomicity. 

This forms part of a broader approach to JavaScript/TypeScript concurrency known as 'promises', where actions can take place concurrently but are controlled through predefined channels to avoid conflicts.

In the context of a larger application, this could be used for a wide range of purposes where the order and control of asynchronous operations matter, like data fetching, UI updates, etc.

Here are the some of the dependencies you've provided:

**BehaviorSubject**

A BehaviorSubject holds some value and delivers it immediately to any new subscribers, before dispatching any subsequent updates.

**queued**

It appears to be a function that wraps a function in a synchronous queue, meaning the function will not be executed if there's a previous execution that hasn't finished yet.

**first**

A utility function that returns the first argument passed to it.

**NEVER_VALUE**
  
A unique symbol that is used in the code to represent a special case where a function returns a value that "should never be used or returned". In context of this "lock" function, it's used to represent a situation where the function is called while in lock state.

Please note this explanation assumes knowledge of TypeScript as well as understanding of Promises and Observables, particularly as implemented in the RxJs library. If any feature of the language or libraries is unclear I would be happy to provide additional information.

## memoizes

a generic `memoize` function that is used to improve performance by caching the result of function calls and reusing the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The function is defined to be generic, with the types `T`, `A`, `K`.

    - `T` is the function type that will be memoized.
    - `A` is the array type of the arguments for the function.
    - `K` is the key type used to store the memoized results.

- The implemented function takes two parameters, `key` and `run`.

    - `key` is a function that generates a unique key based on the arguments of the original function.
    - `run` is the original function that is going to be memoized.

- Inside the `memoize` function:

    - `valueMap` is defined as a new Map. It is used to store the resulting value of the function execution linked with a specific key.

    - `clear` is a function used to clear the `valueMap`. If a key is provided, it deletes the corresponding value from the `valueMap`. If no key is provided, it clears the entire `valueMap`.

    - `executeFn` is a function that will be returned. It uses the provided `key` function to generate a unique key based on the arguments. If the `valueMap` already contains the result for the key, it returns the cached result. Otherwise, it runs the original function with the provided arguments, caches the result associated with the key in `valueMap`, and then returns the newly computed result.
    
    - The function `executeFn` also implements `IClearable` interface using the clear function and adds a special method accessible using the `GET_VALUE_MAP` symbol to allow access to `valueMap`.

The other provided code snippets and files are using the `memoize` function defined here. For example, in `RowMarkProvider` component and the `ttl` function, the `memoize` function is used for caching repetitive computations.

Let's clarify that these memoized functions are not only memoizing the result, but they also have a `clear` method for clearing stored results and a `GET_VALUE_MAP` method for providing `iclearable` interface and friend-like access to internal `valueMap`.

Note: Memoization is a form of caching that involves remembering the result of complex operations and reusing them, rather than recomputing the result repeatedly. This can enhance performance, especially for compute-heavy operations.


## queued

a function `queued` that takes a Promise-making function as its parameter and returns a wrapper object around that Promise. The wrapper object has enhanced capabilities: it can cancel the Promise and clear all queued Promise tasks. 

Here's a brief breakdown of what individual parts of your code do:

- The `queued` function is a higher-order function, i.e., a function that takes another function (in this case, a Promise-making function) as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function with added capabilities (cancelable and clearable Promises).

- It uses two type parameters: `T` is the type of the Promise result, and `P` is the tuple type of arguments that the Promise function might take.

- `lastPromise` stores the most recent Promise made by the wrapper function.

- `cancelFn` is a function to cancel the current Promise in the queue.

- `wrappedFn` is the function object that will be returned. It takes in the same arguments (`...args`) as the original Promise function, executes that function, and allows for its cancellation and clearing. 

- The `clear` and `cancel` methods have been added to `wrappedFn` to allow queued Promise tasks to be reset and canceled.

- The `CANCELED_SYMBOL` is returned if a Promise is canceled.

- It uses higher-order programming concepts (the compose function) and typing to accomplish its goals.

An `IWrappedFn` interface could be described as following:

- Functions which follows this interface take a set of arguments (`...args: P`) and return a Promise of type `T` or `CANCELED_SYMBOL`.

- They also have `cancel()` method to abort the execution of the associated promise, and `clear()` method to clear any active promise created by the wrapper function.

Regarding the given functions and variables, here is a brief explanation:

- `compose` is a function that could be used to chain multiple function calls. It's been used in the function `queued` to create a chain of cancellation operations.

- `Function` is a utility type that could represent a function of arbitrary signature.

- `CANCELED_SYMBOL` is a symbolic representation used to indicate that a scheduled Promise has been canceled.


## retry

 a `retry` function which takes a function `run` and a number `count` as parameters. The function `run` is expected to return a promise and could take any number of arguments of any type, while `count` is the maximum number of retries if `run` fails (default is 5). The `retry` function is generic and can handle functions with a range of different signatures.

The `retry` function wraps the passed function `run` in a `cancelable` function (as imported from `cancelable`). This makes it possible to cancel the operation if it's not needed anymore. It attempts to run the function, and if it fails, it retries until it succeeds or reaches the limit set by `total`. Upon reaching this limit without a successful function call, `retry` will throw the last error that was caught.

Here is an example of a call to `retry`:

```typescript
const reservation = await retry(makeHotelReservation, 3);
```

In the example above, the function `makeHotelReservation` would be called until it succeeds or has been called 3 times. If all 3 retry attempts fail, `retry` will throw the last error `makeHotelReservation` encountered.

The returned function's signature is described by the `IWrappedFn` interface. This interface takes two generic parameters: `T` to represent the type of the resolved promise value, and `P` to represent the type of function's arguments. Using scripts/utilities like this can help manage resilience in your application, as it allows functions to automatically retry in case of their failure, rather than failing immediately.

The `cancelable` function comes with a `cancel` method. When this `cancel` method is invoked on the return value of the `retry` function, it prevents further retries from occurring and rejects with the `CANCELED_SYMBOL` symbol.

Remember that since returned function is cancelable, you can cancel it with `cancel` function like:

```typescript
const retriedFunction = retry(makeHotelReservation, 3);
retriedFunction.cancel();
```

In the example above, if `cancel()` is called before `makeHotelReservation` has completed successfully or failed `count` times, no more attempts will be made to call `makeHotelReservation` and the promise will reject with `CANCELED_SYMBOL`.


## singlerun


The `singlerun` function takes a function `run` as an argument. `run` must be a function that can accept any numbers and types of arguments. The function will return a result that is a composition of the original function and the `IClearable` interface.

```typescript
let result: Task | undefined = undefined;
const fn = (...args: any) => {
    if (result?.status !== "pending") {
        result = new Task(run(...args));
    }
    return result?.target;
};
```

In the function body, a variable `result` is initialized to `undefined`. The `fn` function checks if there is already a `result` that's in the "pending" status. If `result` is not pending, it runs your function with its arguments and stores a new `Task` object in `result`. Then, it returns the `target` property of the `result`.

```typescript 
fn.clear = () => {
    result = undefined;
};
return fn as T & IClearable;
```

`fn` is also extended with a `clear` function that resets `result` to `undefined`. Finally, the function `fn` is returned as a function of type `T` that is also `IClearable`.

This design is called a higher-order function because it accepts a function as an argument, and returns a new function that has been enriched with new behavior, in this case the capability to be executed only once and then being able to clear the result.

For the related code, `Task` is a class that wraps a promise with a state tracking mechanism. This state can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

`IClearable` is an interface defining anything that has a `clear` function/method.

`useSinglerunAction` is a custom hook that uses `singlerun` to manage the state of a long-running asynchronous operation along with error handling and loading state tracking.

The `singlerun` function is imported and used in various places throughout your code.


## singleshot

The `singleshot` function in your TypeScript code is a higher-order function that accepts a function `run` as a parameter and returns a new function `fn`. This returned function behaves as follows:

- On the first call, it executes the `run` function, memoizes (stores) the result, and returns it.
- On subsequent calls, it doesn't execute `run` again but returns the previously stored result.

This behavior is enabled with the help of a flag variable `hasRunned`. This variable is initially `false` and is set to `true` after the first execution of the input function `run`.

Also, the function `fn` gets an additional method `clear`. When called, `clear` resets the `hasRunned` flag to `false`, making the `fn` forget it has ever been run and be able to execute the `run` function again when it's called next time.

The function `singleshot` is designed to work with functions of any signature. The type parameter `T` is constrained to be a function of any number of arguments (`...args: any[]`) and any type of return (`=> any`), but within the function `singleshot`, `T` is treated as a function of specific arguments and a specific return type. TypeScript's type logic ensures that `T` retains this specific functionality when it's returned from `singleshot`.

When returned from the `singleshot`, `fn` is also guaranteed to have the `clear` method because it's added directly to `fn`, and `fn` is returned as `T & IClearable`. This intersection type (`&`) makes TypeScript consider `fn` as something that is both `T` and `IClearable`.

To sum up, the `singleshot` function transforms an input function `run` into a version of it that, once run, keeps returning the initial result and can be reset to its "unrun" state with the `clear` method.

## singletick

a TypeScript function named `singletick` which wraps another function and provides a mechanism to run it in a single event loop tick, and adds a delay before invoking it. 

If we break it down, we have the following:

The function `singletick` is a generic function, that takes a function `run` as an argument and returns a function that is a hybrid of `run` and `IClearable` interface. It is indicated with `T & IClearable`. 

```typescript
export const singletick = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(run: T): T & IClearable => { ... }
```

`IClearable` is defined as:

```typescript
export interface IClearable {
    clear: () => void;
}
```

It is an interface with one function member, `clear`, which doesn't receive any arguments and doesn't return anything (void). 

`singleshot` is an imported function. The actual function is not available here, but it seems like it's expected to return a function. 

In the `singletick` function, the variable `timeout` is declared as nullable and of type `NodeJS.Timer`:

```typescript
let timeout: NodeJS.Timer | null = null;
```

Then `run` is wrapped with `singleshot` and the resulting function is assigned to `singleshotFn`.

```typescript
const singleshotFn = singleshot(run);
``` 

Later, another function called `wrappedFn` is defined that invokes `singleshotFn` with a set of parameters and then setups a timeout to clear `singleshotFn`. This means all the pending tasks of `singleshotFn` would be cleaned up after `singletick.delay` milliseconds.

```typescript
const wrappedFn = (...args: any[]) => {
    const result = singleshotFn(...args);
    timeout !== null && clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        singleshotFn.clear();
        timeout = null;
    }, singletick.delay);
    return result;
};
```

Finally, `wrappedFn` is returned as a function that follows both `T` and `IClearable`, but it's unknown if `wrappedFn` actually includes a `clear` function.

```typescript
return wrappedFn as T & IClearable;
```

`singletick.delay` is referenced in the code, but no more details are provided here.

Keep in mind that if certain functions like `singleshot`, `singleshotFn.clear`, or properties like `singletick.delay` are not appropriately defined elsewhere in the code, this function may result in errors during execution.

## throttle

a `throttle` utility function. The purpose of this function is to limit the rate at which a function can fire by introducing a delay between successive invocations.

Let's break down the code:

1. `export const throttle = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(run: T, delay = 1_000): T & IClearable => {...}`
This part defines the `throttle` function. It uses TypeScript generics to allow any type of function to be throttled. The function `run` is the function to be throttled, and `delay` specifies the throttle duration in milliseconds. By default, the `delay` is set to 1,000 milliseconds (1 second). The function returns a function of type `T` (the original function passed, but throttled) and an interface `IClearable` that exposes a `clear` method.

2. `let timeoutID: any; let cancelled = false; let lastExec = 0;`
These are variables to keep track of the setTimeout ID, whether the throttling is cancelled, and the time when the throttled function was last executed, respectively.

3. `const clearExistingTimeout = () => {...}`
It's a helper function that clears the preexisting timeout if it exists. The aim is to prevent the execution of the throttled function if a new invocation comes before the current delay period ends.

4. `const wrappedFn = (...args: any[]) => {...}`
It's the throttled version of the original `run` function. It works by comparing the time elapsed between the current and last executions. If the elapsed time exceeds the delay, the function is invoked immediately.

5. `if (!timeoutID) {...}` and `if (elapsed > delay) {...}`
These are conditions to immediately execute the function if it's the first invocation or if the delay period has passed since the last execution.

6. `clearExistingTimeout();`
Calls the helper function which determines whether a timeout exists and, if it does, clears it. This ensures that the function doesn't execute more than once within the delay period.

7. `wrappedFn.clear = clearExistingTimeout;`
Attaches the helper function to the returned throttled function so that it's externally accessible. This allows the calling code to interrupt the throttling process if needed.

8. `return wrappedFn as T & IClearable;`
Finally, the throttled function is returned. It's coerced into a type that includes both the original function's type `T` and the clear method (`IClearable` interface).

The `IClearable` interface you've provided is a simple interface with a `clear` function. This interface gives the throttle function the ability to stop executions that are waiting to be run by calling the clear method.

This code is usually used in scenarios when you want to limit the rate of function calls to avoid flooding or overuse of resources, like handling input change events, UI update frequency, or limiting API calls. The throttle function combines both debouncing and throttling concepts to ensure the optimal execution rate of a given function.


## trycatch

a higher-order function called `trycatch`. A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns one as a result. 

```typescript
export const trycatch = <T extends (...args: A) => any, A extends any[], V extends any>(run: T, {
    fallback,
    defaultValue = null,
}: Partial<IConfig> = {}): (...args: A) => ReturnType<T> | null => {
```

In this case, `trycatch` accepts two parameters. The first parameter `run` is the function that will be executed in a try-catch block. This function can take any number of arguments of any type and return any type. This function is described in TypeScript with the generic constraints `<T extends (...args: A) => any, A extends any[]>`. The second parameter is an optional configuration object defined with the interface `IConfig`, and it has two properties:

- `fallback`, a function that takes an Error as a parameter and doesn't return a value, called when an exception occurs in `run`. 
- `defaultValue`, a value of any type, returned when `run` throws an exception. It defaults to `null`.

The `trycatch` function returns a new function based on the given parameters. When this new function is subsequently called:

1. It tries to execute the `run` function with the provided arguments.
   
2. If `run` completes successfully, it returns the result of `run`.

3. If `run` returns a Promise, the returned Promise is awaited using an `awaiter` function, which also includes error handling.
   
4. If `run` throws an exception, the function `fallback` is called with the error, if `fallback` was provided as a configuration. Afterward, `defaultValue` is returned.

The `useFieldGuard` function is an example of `trycatch` usage. `useFieldGuard` creates a guard for field properties. It accepts an options object and returns a result object with guarded field properties, which are set using `trycatch`. The error handling is performed by the `createFallback` function, which logs an error to the console if an exception is caught.

In a broader view, this code could be part of a larger validation system, where individual field validations are guarded with `trycatch` to ensure that an unhandled exception in one validation function doesn't interrupt the entire validation process.

Here is how the `trycatch` function is used in `useFieldGuard`:

```typescript
isDisabled: trycatch(isDisabled, {
  defaultValue: false,
  fallback: createFallback(name, prefix, "isDisabled"),
}) as IResult["isDisabled"],
```

In this case, if `isDisabled` function throws an error, `createFallback(name, prefix, "isDisabled")` will be called, and `false` will be returned since it's set as the `defaultValue`.

## ttl

The `ttl` function takes two parameters:

1. `run`: The original function that will have a cache layer added to it by this higher-order function.
2. `options`: An object with two optional properties:
     - `key`: A function to generate the caching key based on the arguments passed. The default function always returns NEVER_VALUE.
     - `timeout`: An optional number representing the TTL duration in milliseconds. A default timeout (DEFAULT_TIMEOUT) is used if not specified.

It returns a function (named `executeFn`) with the same type as the original one, but with caching functionality added. The cache uses a key and has a TTL. The key is either provided or generated from the function arguments, and the TTL is set in milliseconds. If the current time is later than the stored time plus the TTL for a result, it is considered expired, and the original function is run again to get a fresh result.

A few noteworthy points about the implementation:

- `memoize(key, (...args) => ({value: run(...args), ttl: Date.now()}))` is used to create a memoized version of the original function. It stores the return value and the time it was stored for future use.
- If the stored value is still within its TTL, the function returns it directly. Otherwise, it clears the stale value from the cache and recursively calls itself to get a fresh result.
- It uses `IClearable` and `IRef` interfaces for clearing and getting the data and uses `GET_VALUE_MAP` symbol to access function's internal cache.
- The returned function also has a garbage collector (`gc`) that clears out expired cache entries.

The use of generics, along with high-order functions, enables the `ttl` function to be highly reusable and adaptable to different functionalities and data types.

Keep in mind that this is not related to any UI libraries, like React or Angular. It is a utility function that can be used in any JavaScript or TypeScript project to add memoization with TTL to any function.
