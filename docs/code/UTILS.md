## arrays

The TypeScript function `arrays` is a utility function that transforms properties of nested objects into arrays. 

The function accepts two parameters: 

- `root`: This is the object that needs to be converted.
- `forceArray` (defaults to `false`): This is a boolean flag that if set to `true`, forces the conversion of nested properties into arrays, regardless of if they have numeric key.

The function operates by recursively (a function calling itself) traversing all properties of each object. Whenever it finds a property which is an object and has numeric keys or `forceArray` is set to true, the function converts the property into an array. If the property is an object but it doesn't have numeric keys and `forceArray` is set to false, it keeps the property as it is and continues to the next property. 

The helper function `hasNumberKey` checks if the object has a property with numeric key which is important in determining whether the property needs to be transformed into an array.

Furthermore, the function is implemented with immutability in mind to prevent any side effects. The function doesn't mutate the original `root` object, which is why a copy of it `result` is created and modified instead. 

So, in simpler terms, this function takes an object and transforms it into another object, where properties that are numerically indexed like `{0: 'first', 1: 'second'}` are converted into arrays like `['first', 'second']`, based on the conditions specified in the function.

However, please note that this function has nothing to do with React or the other JavaScript-based code snippets you've included. It's a plain JavaScript (or TypeScript, to be more specific) function which processes a JavaScript object.


## formatText

The given TypeScript function `formatText` is designed to format a raw text string according to a provided template and a set of optional parameters.

Here is a step-by-step outline of its functionality:

- It takes three arguments: `raw` (the original string), `template` (the pattern for the final string), and `params` (an optional object carrying information to customize the formatting).

- If the `template` or `raw` isn't provided, the function simply returns the `raw` string.

- If a `replace` function is provided in `params`, it uses it to create a new version of the `raw` string where some characters may be replaced.

- If an `allowed` condition is provided either as a function or regular expression, it is used to filter out characters in the `raw` string that do not match the criteria.

- After any replacements and removals, the function constructs the final string by looping over the `template` string, and either using the templates' characters or replacing them with characters from `raw`, based on the given symbol or if they match a character in `raw`.

Interfaces and helper functions:
- The `IParams` interface defines the structure of the optional `params` object.
- Some hooks (`useOnePayload`, `useOneState`, etc.) and utility functions (`getCaretPos`, `waitForMove`, etc.) are imported, but aren't used in the `formatText` function itself - perhaps they are used elsewhere in your application.

Overall, this is a text formatting utility function that operates based on a number of customizable parameters. It shows how powerful TypeScript can be when working with strings and custom interfaces.

## formatAmount

This TypeScript code exports a function named `formatAmount` that formats numbers based on three parameters: `value`, `scale`, and `separator`.

Here are the details of each parameter:

- `value`(required): This is the only mandatory parameter, and it can either be a number or a string. The function will convert it to a number type in order to format it.

- `scale`(optional): This defines the number of decimal places you want the `value` to round to. If not provided, it will default to `2`.

- `separator`(optional): This character is used to separate the thousands in the formatted value. If not provided, a comma, represented by `','`, will be used as the default.

The function execution works as follows:

1. Converts given `value` into a `Number`, formats it to precise `scale` number of decimals by using `toFixed` method.

2. If the absolute value of the given `value` is less than `10,000`, the function will return value as is, without applying any thousand separator.

3. But if the absolute `value` is more than or equal to `10,000`, the function will run a `replace()` function with a regular expression that matches every three digits before a decimal point or end of the string and adds the separator.

4. Two more `replace()` functions are called:

   - The first removes decimals if they are `.00`
   - The second one replaces the decimal point `.` with the provided `separator`

The function then returns the formatted string.

Note: The variable `nbsp` is not defined in this code. Presumably, it should be set to the character that you want to use for the thousands separator if the number is 10,000 or greater. If `nbsp` is not defined elsewhere in the code, this function will have a runtime error.


## createLsManager

The provided TypeScript code defines a utility function `createLsManager` that creates and returns an instance of an anonymous class for managing localStorage values. Given a storage key when called, it provides methods for getting, setting, and clearing a value with the corresponding key in the localStorage. 

Below are the details:

`createLsManager` is a generic function that accepts a type `T` which defines the type of the value to be stored in localStorage. It also requires a string input `STORAGE_KEY` that represents the key used to access the stored value in localStorage.

Upon calling this function, it returns an instance of an anonymous class that exposes three methods:

1. `getValue`: This method does not take any parameters. It tries to retrieve the value from localStorage, parses it from a JSON string back into an object of type T or null, and then returns it. If the parsing process fails, it returns null.

2. `setValue`: This method takes in the value of type `T` you wish to store in localStorage. It first converts the value into a JSON string and then attempts to store it in localStorage. If storing the value results in exceeding the localStorage quota, it catches the DOMException error, logs an error message, clears the localStorage and reloads the page.

3. `clear`: This is a method to remove the key-value pair from the localStorage using the provided `STORAGE_KEY`.

```typescript
export const createLsManager = <T = Record<string, any>>(STORAGE_KEY: string) => new class {
    //...
    getValue = (): T | null => {/*...*/};
   
    setValue = (value: T) => {/*...*/};

    clear = () => {/*...*/};
};
```

The provided utility function can be used to manage localStorage for various types of values in your applications. Just instantiate it with a particular storage key, and you can get, set or clear the associated value in localStorage using the resulting object's methods.

## createLsManager

Sure, I can explain this code to you. This TypeScript code snippet exports a function called `createLsStateProvider()`. This function creates a state provider that persists state in the browser's local storage.

The `createLsStateProvider()` function takes a storage key as a parameter. This key is used to save and read data from the local storage.

Here is the breakdown of how it works:

1. It first creates a local storage manager `storageManager` by invoking `createLsManager()`. This local storage manager can get and set values to the local storage, with the provided storage key.

2. It then creates a state provider and state hook using `createStateProvider()`. This state provider component is given some initial state and an `onChange` function, which gets called every time the state changes.

3. The function returns a new component `WrappedStateProvider`, which is a Higher Order Component. This `WrappedStateProvider` takes in `children`(React components), `initialState` (initial state or a function that returns the initial state), and `onChange` (a function to be executed when the state changes) as props.

4. The `WrappedStateProvider` wraps the original `StateProvider` and modifies its behavior. Specifically, it sets the `initialState` of `StateProvider` to either the previously stored value in local storage (if there is one) or the `initialState` provided. 

5. Whenever state changes, the new state is stored in local storage and any `onChange` callback passed into `WrappedStateProvider` is invoked.

6. The function ultimately returns a tuple with `WrappedStateProvider` and `useStateProvider`. The `WrappedStateProvider` is a provider component to be used at the top-level of a component tree, and `useStateProvider` is a hook that can be used in child components to access the state.

In summary, this `createLsStateProvider` provides a mechanism to automatically synchronize state with local storage, ensuring that state is persistent across user sessions until cleared.

Relevant functions that weren't directly defined in the given code but seem to be imported:

- `createLsManager()`: This function creates an object for managing local storage. It provides the `getValue()` and `setValue()` methods for interacting with local storage.
- `createStateProvider()`: This function isn't defined in the given code. But based on context, it seems to create a React context and a hook that allows children components to access and update the state value.
- `reloadPage()`: This function isn't defined in the given code but is likely a simple function that reloads the current page.
  
React, modern JavaScript, and TypeScript features used in this code:

- Higher Order Components(HOC): `WrappedStateProvider` is a higher-order component. HOCs are a way to reuse component logic in React.
- Arrow functions: `() => {}` is an ES6 feature called arrow functions. 
- Generics: `<S extends unknown>` is a TypeScript feature called generics. They let you work with types while maintaining type information.
- `React` and `React.ReactNode`: used for React components and children prop definition types.
- JSX: This is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React, that allows for direct writing of HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript code. 
- `as const`: This is a TypeScript feature that will infer the tuple to be a readonly tuple, preventing you from adding or removing elements.
