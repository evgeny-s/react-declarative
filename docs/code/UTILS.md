# arrays

a function for converting nested object properties to arrays. The function name is `arrays`. It takes two parameters:

1. `root`: This is the root object that you want to convert. Any part of this object that has a key that can be parsed as a number (e.g., "0", "1", "2", etc.) will be transformed into an array.
2. `forceArray`: This is an optional parameter that, if provided as `true`, will cause any object encountered to be converted into an array, even if it has no numeric keys.

The function operates recursively, meaning it will convert objects nested within objects. The conversion process checks to see if an object has at least one property key that is a number, or if the `forceArray` parameter is set to `true`, it converts the object's properties into an array using `Object.values()`. This new array replaces the original object in the `root` parameter.

There is a supporting `hasNumberKey` function shown separately, which checks if an object has at least one numeric key. This function goes through all the keys of an object, checking if at least one of them satisfies the `NUMBER_EXPR.test(key)` condition where `NUMBER_EXPR` is a regular expression that matches numeric strings.

The code also includes a testing setup using Jest, which verifies the functioning of the `arrays` function.

Overall, this function could be useful in situations where you have JavaScript objects but want to interact with them like they are arrays — for instance, if you want to use array methods like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`.


# asciiParams

`parseAsciiParams`, takes an array of ASCII codes and converts them into an object. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<T extends {} = Record<string, any>>` bit in the function signature defines a generic type `T` that extends from empty object, {}. The default type if none is provided is `Record<string, any>`. This means that the function can return any object type, but by default it will return an object where keys are strings and values can be of any type.
  
- The parameter `state` is an array of numbers, intended to be ASCII codes.

- The `map((char) => String.fromCharCode(char))` line converts each ASCII code into their corresponding character. `join('')` merges all the characters into a single string.

- `split(';')` takes the resulting string and splits it into an array separating each key-value pair. Then, each pair is split into a key and a value using `map((line) => line.split('='))`.

- The second `map` conditional section parses some specific values:
  - If the value equals the string "true", it returns a boolean `true`.
  - If the value equals the string "false", it returns a boolean `false`.
  - If the value equals the string "null", it returns `null`.
  - If the value is a valid number, it returns the parsed `float` value.
  - Otherwise, it leaves the value as-is (a string).

- All of the key-value pairs are then transformed into an object using `Object.fromEntries()`. 

- If there are any errors during this process (such as a faulty input), a try-catch block will return `null`.

Please let me know if you need a more detailed explanation or if there's a specific part you don't understand.

# parseBase64Json

 `parseBase64Json` is a functionality that decodes a Base64 string into a JSON object.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

- It is a generic function that takes a parameter called `state` of type string.
- The function attempts to parse a Base64-encoded JSON string to a JavaScript object. This is done by using the `decode` method of the `base64` object to convert the Base64-encoded input to a normal string, and then parsing that string with `JSON.parse` to convert it to a JavaScript object.
- If any error occurs while decoding or parsing (for example, if the input string isn't valid Base64 or doesn't represent a valid JSON object), it catches the error and returns null.
- The function written in this way allows TypeScript to infer the type of the returned object based on how the function is used.

Let's consider the following usage of this function: `let obj = parseBase64Json<{name: string, age: number}>('.....');`

In this case, TypeScript can infer that `obj` will be either null or an object with properties `name` and `age`, where `name` is a string and `age` is a number.

The provided `base64` object has `decode` and `encode` methods for Base64 encoding and decoding. The `decode` method is used in `parseBase64Json`.

In `decode`, it essentially converts a Base64 string back into its original form. It uses the fact that each character in a Base64 string represents 6 bits of the original data, and so 4 characters in a Base64 string represent 3 bytes (24 bits) of the original data. It finds each character in the input string in the index of a string of all possible Base64 characters (`_keyStr`), which gives a number from 0 to 63 (representing 6 bits of data). Then, by shifting and masking bits, it gets back the original 3 bytes. This is repeated until all characters in the input string have been processed. 

The `encode` method does the opposite of the `decode` method and is not immediately relevant to your question but provided for completeness.

# stringifyBase64Json

a utility function to turn an object of type `T` (defaulted to `Record<string, any>`) into a Base64-encoded JSON string. This function accomplishes its task in a few steps: it first turns the input state object into a JSON string with `JSON.stringify(state)`, then encodes this JSON string into Base64.

So, let's take a closer look at your function:

```typescript
stringifyBase64Json = <T = Record<string, any>>(state: T) => {
  return base64.encode(JSON.stringify(state));
}
```

The `<T = Record<string, any>>` syntax means that this function is generic, that is, it can work with arguments of any type. That is, `T` can be any TypeScript type. However, if you don't specify the type when you call the function, TypeScript assumes that `T` is a `Record<string, any>`. The `state: T` means that the function takes one argument `state` of type `T`.

The function call `base64.encode(JSON.stringify(state))` first converts the state object into a JSON formatted string with `JSON.stringify(state)`. Then it encodes the resulting string into base64 format using `base64.encode`.

The `base64.encode` is defined in the `base64` object:

```typescript
const base64 = new class {
  _keyStr = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/=";

  encode = (input: any) => {
    ...
    return output;
  };
  ...
}
```

Here, the function `encode` is designed to convert a string into a Base64-encoded string. It does this by taking each character of the input, converting it to its char code, and using the char code to generate the Base64 string.

To summarize, the `stringifyBase64Json` function is a utility function taking in an object and outputting a base64 encoded JSON string. It uses the base64 object's `encode` function to achieve the base64 encoding.


# cacheSrc

`cacheSrc`, is a method that returns a function to cache image URLs and then apply them to an HTMLImageElement. It employs the closure feature of JavaScript to remember the `url` parameter for subsequent use.

Here's an explanation of the code:

```typescript
/**
 * Sets the image source of a given HTMLImageElement by caching the image.
 * @param url - The URL of the image to cache.
 * @returns - A function that takes an HTMLImageElement as input and sets its source with the cached image.
 */
export const cacheSrc = (url: string) => ({
    ref: (element: HTMLImageElement | null) => { // The returned function
        if (element) {
            element.style.visibility = 'hidden'; 
            cacheManager.createPromise(url).then((blob) => { // Create a Promise to cache the image
                if (document.contains(element)) { // If the image element is still in the DOM
                    element.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob); // Set the image source to the cached image
                    element.style.visibility = 'visible'; // Reveal the image with the new source
                }
            });
        }
    }
});
```

As you mentioned, there are several methods namely `createPromise`, `_cacheMap` and `toBlob` used within this code.

- `cacheManager.createPromise(url)`: It creates a Promise that returns a Blob object. If a Blob for the URL doesn't already exist in the cache (verified via `_cacheMap`), it will create a new Blob via `toBlob(url)` and store that in the cache.
- `_cacheMap`: This is a Map used as a cache. The keys in this Map are URLs of images, and the values are Promises that resolve to Blob objects representing the images.
- `toBlob`: This method converts an image URL `src` to a `Promise<Blob>`. It uses a Canvas to load the image and convert it into a `Blob` enriched with the image data.

The use of caching in this manner aims to enhance performance by avoiding redundant network requests for the images. It can be especially beneficial if the same image is being rendered multiple times or across different components. Until the image from the `url` is finished loading and blop is created, the related HTMLImageElement will be hidden. Once the blop is ready and loaded as a source for HTMLImageElement, it will be set to visible.


# chooseFile

a function called `chooseFile` that opens a file chooser dialog using the browser's underlying input element of the type 'file'. Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:

```typescript
export const chooseFile = (accept?: string) => new Promise<File | null>((res) => {
    const input = document.createElement('input');
```
At the start, the function takes an optional string parameter `accept`, which is a file type filter that can be a comma-separated list of MIME types or file extensions used to limit the type of files that can be selected from the dialog.

Next, the function creates a Promise that resolves with the selected file (as a `File` type) or `null` if the selection is cancelled by the user. This Promise creation is where most of the functionality lies.

Inside the Promise, a new HTML input element of the type 'file' is created and appended to the document body. If the `accept` parameter is provided, it's assigned to the `accept` attribute of the input element to filter the files.

```typescript
    input.onchange = () => {
        if (document.body.contains(input)) {
            document.body.removeChild(input);
        }
        isCanceled = false;
        const files = input.files;
        if (!files?.length) {
          return;
        }
        res(files[0])
        input.value = '';
    }
```
An `onchange` event is attached to the `input` element. When a file is selected, this event is fired, removing the input element from the document body and retrieving the selected file from `input.files` array. The Promise resolves with this selected file. It also checks if selection was cancelled, and if so, it doesn't do anything and the control returns from the function. If the file is chosen, `res(files[0])` is called, meaning the promise resolves with the first file. Afterwards, `input.value = ''` resets the value of the input. 

```typescript
    waitForResume().then(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (isCanceled) {
                if (document.body.contains(input)) {
                    document.body.removeChild(input);
                }
                res(null);
            }
        }, CLEANUP_DELAY)
    });
```
The `waitForResume` function, presumably, waits for some user action. After the resume, it sets a timeout equal to `CLEANUP_DELAY`. If the selection was cancelled (`isCanceled` is `true`), the `input` element is removed from the document body and the Promise is resolved with `null`.

Finally, `input.click();` triggers the file dialog to open.

Please note that this explanation does not involve the functions of attachments because they were not used in the provided code.

Also, please note the related code posted along the question is not directly related to the `chooseFile` function. They seem to be part of a bigger application where the function may be used.

# chooseMultipleFiles

a function called `chooseMultipleFiles` that opens a file chooser dialog to allow a user to select multiple files.

It takes an optional string parameter `accept` that can be used to filter the types of files that the dialog will display. This string should be a MIME type, like "image/jpeg" for JPEG images.

Here is a detailed explanation of what this function does:

1. The function returns a new promise that resolves to either an array of `File` objects or `null`. The promise is resolved once a user has either picked files through the dialog or canceled the operation.

2. An HTML `input` element is created for this purpose. 

3. The `type` attribute of the `input` element is set as `'file'` which makes it behave like a file input control. The `multiple` attribute is set to `"1"` which allows the user to select multiple files at once.

4. The `style.display` attribute is set to `"none"` to make the `input` element invisible, as users don't need to interact with it directly.

5. If the `accept` parameter is provided, it is used to set the `accept` field of the `input` element which restricts the file types that can be picked.

6. The `input` element is added to the body of the document.

7. `onchange` event listener is added to the `input` element. This listener will be triggered once the user selects files. Inside this listener:
   - If the `input` element is present in the document body, it gets removed.
   - A flag `isCanceled` is set to `false`.
   - All the selected files are resolved from the promise.
   - The `value` of the `input` element is cleared.

8. The function waits for the user to interact with the document using `waitForResume` function.

9. After user interaction, a `setTimeout` fires after a delay defined by `CLEANUP_DELAY` which checks for the `isCanceled` flag. If it's `true`, it means the user hasn't selected any files and the function removes the `input` element from the document body if it exists, and resolves the promise with `null`.

10. The `click` method is invoked programmatically on this `input` element to open the file chooser dialog.

The `waitForResume` function waits until the user resumes interaction (by moving the mouse or touching the screen) after a delay defined by `AWAIT_DELAY`. It also uses an import from another module, a sleep function, to delay execution of some code.

Overall, this code provides a method for users to select multiple files from the file chooser dialog, such as uploading multiple files at once to a server. It does this by programmatically creating an `input` element and using a promise to provide these files to the caller of `chooseMultipleFiles`.

# classNames


The `classNames` function is a utility function used quite frequently in front-end web development in JavaScript and TypeScript. Its purpose is to dynamically construct class names for HTML elements.

Let's explain the code step by step:

1. `export const classNames = (...args: any[]) => {...};`

This function takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) thanks to the rest parameter syntax (`...args`). The argument type is `any` which means it can handle arguments of any type. 

2. `const classes: Array<string> = [];` 

An empty array `classes` of type `string` is initialized. This array will hold the classes that will be used for an HTML element.

3. If an argument (`arg`) is non-null, it is processed as follows:

   1. If the argument is a string, the string is assumed to be a class name and added to the array `classes`.

   2. If the argument is an array:

        - The `classNames` function is called recursively on the array elements.
        - If the result is not an empty string, the resulting string is added to the array `classes`.

   3. If the argument is an object:

       - If the object has its own `toString` method (meaning it was likely added via a class prototype), the result of calling `toString` on the object is added to the classes.
       - If the object does not have its own `toString` method (meaning it's a plain object), then `Object.entries(arg)` is used to get an array of `[key, value]` pairs from the object, and if the value is truthy, then the key (assumed to be a classname) is added to the array `classes`.

4. Finally, the function returns the array `classes`, concatenated into a string with class names separated by a space.

In short, this `classNames` function accepts a range of data types and structures as input, and outputs a correctly-formatted string of class names for use in a HTML class attribute. It's extremely useful for dynamically styling components where the style may change based upon various properties or state.

# compareArray

a function called `compareArray` that accepts two arguments `a_arr` and `b_arr`. The `any` type indicates that TypeScript does not check any constraints on the type of values these arguments can hold.

```typescript
if (Array.isArray(a_arr) && Array.isArray(b_arr)) {
```
This checks if both input parameters are arrays.

```typescript
if (a_arr.length !== b_arr.length) {
    return false;
}
```
This checks if the lengths of both arrays are the same. If not, the function returns `false`, meaning the arrays are not equal.

```typescript
const a_sort = [...a_arr].sort(compareFn);
const b_sort = [...b_arr].sort(compareFn);
```
Here, both arrays are first cloned using the spread operator (`...`), then sorted using a function referred to as `compareFn`. 

```typescript
return a_sort.every((value, index) => value === b_sort[index]);
```
Finally, the function compares each element of the sorted arrays based on their indices using the `every()` function. If all corresponding elements in both arrays are the same, the function returns `true`, indicating that the arrays are equal. Otherwise, it returns `false`.


In conclusion, this function performs a deep equality check between two arrays.

# compareFulltext

a generic function `compareFulltext`. This function is designed to compare a search term (a string) against one or more values in an object (data) of any type (that extends a Record). You can specify the keys to be compared from the object in the function arguments. It works by checking if any word in the keys of the data object includes any word in the search term.

Here's a breakdown:

- `T extends Record<string, any>`: This is a constraint for the generic type `T` where `T` has to be an object (or extend from an object) where the keys are strings, and the values can be anything.

- `(data: T, search: string, ...keys: string[])`: These are the parameters for the function. The first parameter `data` is of the generic type `T`. The second parameter `search` is the string you want to search. The rest parameter `...keys` is an array of strings which contains the keys to be searched in the `data` parameter.

- `const target = String(search || "")`: The `search` term is coerced to a string and lowered cased. If `search` is falsy, an empty string `""` is used. This string is then split by spaces into an array of words `target`.

- `const filterFn = (key: string) => {...}`: This is a function that takes in a string `key` and checks if all the words in `target` are present in any of the words of the property value of `data` associated with the key. The property value is also split into an array of words by space.

- The `for` loop iterates over the `keys` array, and at least one of the keys must return `true` from `filterFn` to set the `isOk` variable to `true`.

The function finally returns `isOk`, which will be `true` if there is a match and `false` otherwise.

In summary, `compareFulltext` searches for the presence of any word in the `search` string in any of the property values of the `data` object you specified by `keys`.

# compose

The `compose` function in your TypeScript code is a utility function that takes an arbitrary number of functions (could be zero, one or more) and returns a new function. This new function, when called, will execute the original functions in right-to-left order. 

Here is a simplified explanation for each condition:

- If `compose` is invoked without any function (i.e., `funcs.length === 0`), it returns a function that accepts a generic type `T` and returns this same `T`. Basically, it returns the given argument without modification.

- If `compose` is called with a single function (i.e., `funcs.length === 1`), it returns that function directly.

- If `compose` is invoked with more than one function, it uses the `Array.reduce` method to create a new function. This new function, when invoked, will execute all the input functions in right-to-left order and the output of each function will be the input to the next. This behavior is commonly referred to as function composition.

This utility function can be extremely helpful in cases where there are various transformations or actions that need to be applied in a certain order. For example, in your code, the `scrollStateSubject.connect` method returns a disposer function, which is combined with `clearInterval` using `compose`, to ensure that both actions get executed when necessary.

```typescript
return compose(
    () => scrollInterval && clearInterval(scrollInterval),
    unDragState
 );
```

This is just one of the instances where `compose` is used. It is also used similarly in `Observer` class's `connect` method, and inside the function handling the `dragStateSubject` and `touchStartSubject`. 

Remember, the order of composition is right-to-left, so the last supplied argument function to `compose` will be executed first, and so on. So, in the example code above, `unDragState` (the process of unsubscribing from the 'drag' state changes) will execute first, followed by clearing the `scrollInterval`.

# copyToClipboard

The `copyToClipboard` function is an asynchronous function (the `async` keyword makes it return a `Promise`) that attempts to copy a string to the system clipboard.

Back to the `copyToClipboard` function, it takes one parameter, `text: string`, which is the text you want to copy to the clipboard. The `async` keyword means that the function will return a promise.

Inside the function body, `isOk` is a boolean flag that indicates if the operation is successful. 

Then we get to a `try catch` block. This is used to handle potential errors in asynchronous operations.

In the `try` clause, it first checks if there is an `overrideRef`. If `overrideRef` is present, it is called with `text` as an argument. Since this call is preceded with the `await` keyword, if `overrideRef` is a function that returns a Promise, `copyToClipboard` will pause until that Promise settles, and then resume.

If `overrideRef` isn't present, the code will use `doCopy` function to copy the text.

The `doCopy` function checks if `'copyToClipboard'` is in `navigator`. If it is, it uses `navigator.copyToClipboard` to copy the text. If it's not, it falls back to `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. If an error occurs in either of these operations, it will attempt to use a `fallbackCopy` method to copy the text.

If any errors are thrown during any of these operations, the control moves to the `catch` block where the error is logged to the console and `isOk` is set to `false`.

Regardless of whether an error was thrown or not (thanks to the `finally` clause), the function will then return the `isOk` variable, indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

The `fallbackCopy` function then provides a fallback method for copying text to the clipboard, using older browser techniques. It creates a text area within the HTML document, places the text into this area, selects it (as if the user had highlighted it), and then attempts to copy this selection.

The `createCopyHandler` function creates a new function that will wait for a user event (like a click), verify that `content` is one of the acceptable types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `undefined`, or `null`), then attempt to `copyToClipboard` and `await` this operation, causing the `createCopyHandler` promise to pause until copy has completed.

Without detailed information about `overrideRef`, I can't tell you exactly what it is. It could be a React reference.

# create

 create a nested property within an object based on a provided path. 

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. First, it ensures that the `path` parameter is an array. If the provided path isn't an array, it assumes it is a string and splits it by the `.` character. It then filters out any falsey keys from this array (like empty strings).

```typescript
const pathArray = Array.isArray(path) ? path : path.split('.').filter((key: any) => key);
```

2. Then, it 'flattens' this array by splitting up any arrays that were included as elements in `pathArray`. This is useful in a case where the `path` parameter might include sub-properties within an array (like `person.jobs[0]`), and it prevents the need for nested looping.

```typescript
const pathArrayFlat = pathArray.flatMap((part: any) => typeof part === 'string' ? part.split('.') : part);
```

3. Finally, it goes through each element in the flatten `pathArrayFlat` (excluding the last element) and creates properties on the original `object` based on these keys. It uses the `reduce` function to successively dig into the object and create properties as necessary. If a property already exists, it uses that one; otherwise, it creates a new object.

```typescript
pathArrayFlat.slice(0, pathArrayFlat.length - 1).reduce((obj: any, key: any) => obj[key] = obj[key] ? obj[key] : {}, object);
```

This function seems to be a utility function for manipulating objects based on string paths, which are common in Javascript for accessing deeply nested properties. It would be very useful in a scenario where you want to programmatically set deeply nested values in an object, but don't know the path ahead of time. An example usage could be something as simple as setting a user's email with a path like `user.contactInfo.email`.

Please note that this function does not have a return statement, and will not provide any output. It modifies the passed object in place.

# createCustomTag

a function `createCustomTag`, which creates a custom HTML tag element.

```typescript
export const createCustomTag = (name = "bgcolor-red", style = "", {
    onClick, onInit,
}: Partial<IConfig> = {}) => { ... };
```
This function takes three parameters:

1. `name` (default value is "bgcolor-red") - This is used as the name for the custom HTML tag.
2. `style` (default value is "") - This is the inline style to apply to the custom HTML tag.
3. An object containing `onClick` and `onInit` functions as event handlers (default value is an empty object) - These configurations are meant for custom click and initialization behavior.

The third parameter uses `Partial<IConfig>` (from the provided interface `IConfig`). The use of `Partial<T>` makes all properties in `T` optional, meaning the user of the function does not need to provide both `onClick` and `onInit` if they don't need to.

Inside the `createCustomTag` function, a `CustomTagFactory` function is defined which creates an `HTMLDivElement` (called `self`) through `Reflect.construct(HTMLElement, [], CustomTagFactory)`. The `HTMLDivElement` is subsequently styled using the provided style string and event handlers are attached if they exist.

```typescript
const self: HTMLDivElement = Reflect.construct(HTMLElement, [], CustomTagFactory);
self.setAttribute("style", style);
if (onInit) {
    onInit(self);
}
if (onClick) {
    self.onclick = onClick;
}
```

The `CustomTagFactory.prototype` is then set to `Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype)` before the custom element is defined using `customElements.define`.

```typescript
CustomTagFactory.prototype = Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype);
customElements.define(name, CustomTagFactory as any);
```

In the provided interface `IConfig`, two method signatures are defined:

```typescript
interface IConfig {
    onClick: (e: MouseEvent) => void;
    onInit: (element: HTMLDivElement) => void;
}
```

These are used to specify the shape of the object expected to be passed into the `createCustomTag` function for providing the custom click and initialization behavior.

# createDict

a function named `createDict` that takes an object of a certain type `T` (where `T` extends a `Dict` type) and converts this object into a dictionary, which it then returns. The dictionary is constructed in a way that it does not inherit properties from `Object.prototype`, and is frozen (i.e., its properties cannot be added, removed, or changed).

Let's break down the code to get a better understanding:

1. `export const createDict = <T extends Dict = Dict>(record: T) => {...}`: This is the declaration of the function `createDict`, which is a generic function with a constraint. The `T` must be a subtype of `Dict` (`T extends Dict`) or, by default, `Dict` (`= Dict`).

2. `const dict = Object.create(null);`: This line creates a new empty object `dict` that does not inherit any properties or methods from `Object.prototype`. This is done using `Object.create` with `null` as the parameter, so there are no inherited properties/methods in `dict`.

3. `Object.assign(dict, record);`: This line uses the `Object.assign` method to copy all enumerable own properties from the `record` object to the `dict` object. After this statement's execution, `dict` will have the same properties as `record`.

4. `return Object.freeze(dict);`: This line freezes the `dict` object, preventing new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed, and preventing existing properties, or their enumerability, configurability, or writability, from being changed. The object is then returned.

In relation to the additional piece of code, `type Dict = Record<string, any>;`, this defines the `Dict` type. This type is an alias for an object type where the keys are strings and the values can be any type. The `Dict` type is used in `createDict` for the `record` parameter and the default type for `T`.

# createLsManager

a utility function named `createLsManager` that generates an anonymous class for managing local storage interactions. This class mainly has three methods for getting, setting, and clearing a value in the local storage. Here are the details of these methods:

- `getValue`: This method retrieves the value associated with the provided `STORAGE_KEY` from local storage. This method tries to parse the value from JSON format and if an error occurs during parsing, it returns `null`.

- `setValue`: This method sets the value for the provided `STORAGE_KEY`. It first stringifies the value to JSON format and then tries to set the stringified value in local storage. If the local storage quota is exceeded while setting the value (throws `DOMException`), the method clears the local storage and reloads the page.

- `clear`: This method removes the value of the provided `STORAGE_KEY` from the local storage.

The `createLsManager` function uses generic syntax `<T = Record<string, any>>` to allow the calling code to specify the type for key/value pair it manages. If no type is specified, it defaults to `Record<string, any>`.

The generated manager class can be later used for any local storage interactions where a specific key is used repeatedly. 

Another part of the provided code is about the function `createLsStateProvider` which is a higher order component that wraps the `StateProvider` component and provides additional functionality. It uses the anonymous class returned by `createLsManager` to manage a single item in the state. It also takes an optional callback function `onChange` which is triggered whenever the state changes.

Please note that `createLsStateProvider` uses `createLsManager` and `createStateProvider`, which are assumed to be available in the local scope (either imported or declared in the same scope).

Here is what these methods essentially do:

- `StateProvider` component uses initial state value from local storage (if available, else uses provided `initialState`) and sets up listener for state changes to store the updated state in local storage as well as triggering the `onChange` callback (if provided).

- `useStateProvider` is a hook provided by the `createStateProvider` function. It is returned alongside `WrappedStateProvider` and expected to be used within the component wrapped by `WrappedStateProvider`.

Please note that I would require additional information about `createStateProvider` and `reloadPage` to give a more comprehensive explanation regarding their role and usage in the provided code.

# createLsStateProvider

 a state provider that is capable of persisting state in the browser's local storage. 

The main function, `createLsStateProvider`, accepts a generic parameter `S` which specifies the type of the state, along with a string parameter, `storageKey`, which specifies the key used to store the state value in local storage.

The function uses two local utility functions, `createLsManager` and `createStateProvider`, to manage the local storage with the provided key and create a state provider, respectively.

`createLsManager` is a function that creates a manager object for local storage. It provides the capabilities to `getValue` from local storage, `setValue` into local storage, and `clear` the value from local storage. The `getValue` and `setValue` functions handle the complexities of serializing and deserializing JSON when storing and retrieving the state from local storage.

`createStateProvider` function is not shown, but it seems to be a function that returns a React component (StateProvider) wrapped with state management and a hook function (useStateProvider) for the component's state management.

It then declares `WrappedStateProvider`, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that extends the functionality of `StateProvider`. This extended functionality includes the capability to automatically save the state to local storage whenever the state changes and initialize the state from local storage.

Finally, `createLsStateProvider` function returns a tuple `[WrappedStateProvider, useStateProvider]` which are the wrapped state provider component and the state change hook.

Usage of this function would allow creation of a stateful component that persists its state in local storage, and a hook function that allows other components to interact with this state. Changes to the state are automatically persisted into local storage.

Please note that the behavior of these functions may depend on their actual implementation which was not provided in the original snippet, this explanation is based on the code and comments provided.

# createSsManager

a function `createSsManager`, a utility for managing session storage keys and values in the browser.

This function takes one argument, `STORAGE_KEY`, which is a string representing the key used to store a value in the browser's session storage.

The `createSsManager` function returns an instance of an anonymous class with three methods: `getValue`, `setValue`, and `clear`.

Here's a breakdown of each method:

* `getValue`: This method retrieves a value from the session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`. If the value is found, it is parsed from a JSON string to its original format and returned. If the value is not found, or if an error occurs while parsing the JSON string, the method returns `null`.

 ```typescript
    /**
     * Retrieves the value from the sessionStorage.
     *
     * @returns The value retrieved from sessionStorage, or null if an error occurred while parsing or the value is not found.
     */
    getValue = (): T | null => {
        try {
            return JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY) || 'null');
        } catch {
            return null;
        }
    };
 ```
* `setValue`: This method takes a value, converts it to a JSON string, and stores it in the session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`. It also handles `DOMException` which may occur when the session storage is full, in such a case, it clears the session storage and reloads the page.

 ```typescript
    /**
     * Sets the value in the session storage.
     *
     * @param value - The value to be set.
     * @returns
     */
    setValue = (value: T) => {
        try {
            sessionStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(value, null, 2));
        } catch (error) {
            if (error instanceof DOMException) {
                console.log('react-declarative createSsManager exceeded the quota');
                sessionStorage.clear();
                reloadPage();
            }
        }
    };
 ```
* `clear`: This method removes a value from the session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`.

 ```typescript
    clear = () => {
        sessionStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEY)
    };
 ```

The `<T = Record<string, any>>` part of the function signature is a default generic type. This allows TypeScript to infer the type of data stored in the session storage. It defaults to a `Record` of any key-value pair if no type is provided.

The `createSsStateProvider` function is used to create a state provider for React components with support for persistent state storage. This function uses createSsManager to implement state persistence by storing the state values in the session storage. It wraps the original StateProvider component to automatically store state changes in the session storage and to initialise the state value from the session storage.

# createSsStateProvider

The `createSsStateProvider` function in your TypeScript JSX code aims to bridge the gap between React's state management and session storage. It generates a more sophisticated state provider for React components with persistent state support using the session storage.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of your code does:

- `createSsStateProvider` is a generic function that takes in a `storageKey` and returns a higher-order (wrapper) component `WrappedStateProvider` and a hook function `useStateProvider`. The `S` generic type refers to the type of the state object.

- `createSsManager` is used to create a manager for session storage.

- `createStateProvider` is a function that creates a `StateProvider` and a `useStateProvider` hook. The `StateProvider` is a context provider component, while `useStateProvider` is a hook that can be used to access the context value.

- `WrappedStateProvider` is a React functional component that renders `StateProvider`, passing in a computed initial state and an `onChange` callback.

- The initial state is calculated by trying to get a value from session storage, falling back to `initialState` if no value was found. 

- The `onChange` function stores the new state value in session storage whenever `StateProvider` changes its state value. 

- The function then returns an array containing `WrappedStateProvider`, and `useStateProvider` as constant. 

The `createSsManager` works with session storage to provide methods: 

- `getValue`, retrieves a value from the session storage, 
- `setValue`, sets a value in the session storage,
- `clear`, removes a value from the session storage.

The `reloadPage` function is used when an error occurs while setting a value in session storage, it clears the storage and reloads the page. 

The `createSsStateProvider` supplies your React components with a state that persists across page refreshes by synchronizing it with session storage.
  
Here's example of usage how it could be used:

```tsx
const [MyStateProvider, useMyState] = createSsStateProvider<{counter: number}>('my-storage-key');

// In the root component
<MyStateProvider initialState={{counter: 0}}>
  <ChildComponent />
</MyStateProvider>

// In the child component
const ChildComponent = () => {
  const state = useMyState();
  return <div>Counter: {state.counter}</div>
};
```

In the above, `createSsStateProvider` is used to create a state provider and a custom hook for a specific key 'my-storage-key'. The state provider is then used to wrap the main application component, providing an initial state. The custom hook is then used to access the state within a child component.


# createStateProvider

used to create a custom hook for providing and consuming a state in a React context.

It imports the necessary functions from React:

- `createContext` - to create a new context.
- `useContext` - to consume a context.
- `useState` - to create a state variable.
- `useCallback` - to create a memoized version of a callback function.
- `useMemo` - to create a memoized value.

The function `createStateProvider` creates a context that holds a state and a function to update the state. `S extends unknown` indicates that `S` (the state type) can be any type.

Inside the `createStateProvider` function:

- It creates a new context `Context` that holds a two-elements array: a state of the type `S`, and a function to update the state.
- `Provider` is a component that uses the props `children`, `initialState`, and `onChange`. It creates a state `state` with a setter `setState` using `useState` initialized from the `initialState` prop.
- `useChange` is a custom hook that runs `onChange` every time when `state` is updated.
- `setProviderState` is a callback that sets the new state. It encapsulates the state setter `setState`.
- Then it creates a memoized array `value` that contains the current state and the state setter. This array is the value that will be provided to the context.
- `Provider` renders a `Context.Provider` that provides the current state and the state setter to all its children.
- `useStateProvider` is a hook that consumes the state from the context.

Then the `createStateProvider` function returns a tuple `[Provider, useStateProvider]`. 

You would use this state provider by declaring a new context with its own Provider that also handles its state, and then consuming the state with the `useStateProvider` hook. 

This allows you to have a global state or multiple contexts each with its own state that you can access from any component in your application.

# createValueProvider

a Utility Function `createValueProvider` to construct a Context Provider and its associated hook conveniently in a React application. It is written in JSX. The provided JSX features suggest that it's designed to be used for React applications and uses Context API for prop drilling avoidance. 

  
Here's what each part does: 

1. The `createValueProvider` function takes an optional `defaultValue` parameter and creates a new `Context` with that default value. This default value is used when there is no matching `Provider` above in the tree. If `defaultValue` is not provided, null will be used.

```typescript
const Context = createContext<P>(defaultValue || null as never);
```

2. A `Provider` component is then defined which accepts two props - `children` and `payload`. The `children` prop represents the child components the `Provider` is wrapping around, and the `payload` prop represents the value that the `Provider` gives to these children components.

```typescript
const Provider = ({
    children,
    payload
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode;
    payload: P;
}) => (
    <Context.Provider value={payload}>
        {children}
    </Context.Provider>
);
```

3. A `usePayload` function is created which is essentially a wrapper over the useContext Hook from React library to provide the value from the nearest `Context`.

```typescript
const usePayload = () => useContext(Context);
```

4. The function then returns a tuple with the React `Provider` component and the `usePayload` hook for using the provided value. This way, developer can choose to use the `usePayload` Hook whenever data from the context is required.

```typescript
return [Provider, usePayload] as const;
```

With this function, you can create a common pattern of provider and useX hook to access the context in a very concise and type-safe way.

# createWindowHistory

The TypeScript function `createWindowHistory` checks the current environment where your application is running and decides whether to use a Memory History or a Browser History.

Here's what each kind of history signifies:

1. **Memory History** - This is a history keeper that works in memory of the device. This is mainly useful in non-browser environments (like tests and React Native) where you don't have a browser's URL bar.

2. **Browser History** - This is used when your application is running inside a web browser. It can manage and maintain the history state using the URL of the web browser.

Now, let's go through the code:

The function checks if the `location` object is available in the `globalThis` object. The `globalThis` object is a standard name for the global object in different JavaScript environments, such as `window` in a browser and `global` in Node.js.

- If there is no `location` (which usually means we are not in a web browser), it chooses a Memory History as it's likely running in a non-browser environment.
- If the `location` is defined and its protocol is 'file:' (which usually means it is being run from a local file system), it also chooses a Memory History.
- If neither of those conditions is true, it chooses a Browser History, assuming it runs in a web browser where URLs are available.

Here is a block of the code properly formatted with TypeScript:

```typescript
/**
 * Determines whether the application should use a memory history or a browser history based on the current environment.
 * @returns - The appropriate history object based on the current environment.
 */
export const createWindowHistory = (): MemoryHistory | BrowserHistory => {
    if (!globalThis.location) {
        return createMemoryHistory();
    } else if (globalThis.location?.protocol === 'file:') {
        return createMemoryHistory();
    } else {
        return createBrowserHistory();
    }
};
```

This function is imported and used wherever history management is required, based on the environment it runs in. In the related code given, you can see it being imported for usage:

```typescript jsx
import createWindowHistory from "../../utils/createWindowHistory";
```
```typescript
import createWindowHistory from "../../../utils/createWindowHistory";
```
With this function, you can gracefully handle various environments where your application may run, thus making it portable and flexible.


# crypt

a simple string encryption function in ECMAScript 6 (now simply known as JavaScript). The `crypt` function takes two parameters: `salt`, and `text`. Let's break down the operations performed by the function.

1. `textToChars`: A helper function that splits a string into an array of individual characters and then maps these characters into their corresponding ASCII values using the `charCodeAt()` method.

2. `byteHex`: A helper function that takes a numerical value and converts it into a hexadecimal representation. If the hexadecimal is only one digit (for example, converting 15 gives 'f'), it adds a '0' in front of it to make it two digits ('0f').

3. `applySaltToChar`: A helper function that applies a bitwise XOR operation to ASCII of salt characters and a given ASCII code of text's character.

4. `crypt` function: Splits the input text into an array of individual characters, converts these characters to their corresponding ASCII values, performs a bitwise XOR operation on the ASCII values of the salt and the text's characters, converts the result of XOR operation to hexadecimal, and then joins the array into a single string which represents the encrypted form of the original text.

Here's the execution steps:
- The input text is converted into ASCII codes using `textToChars()`.
- `applySaltToChar` applies the XOR operation on each ASCII code from the input text and the ASCII codes from the salt.
- The result of the XOR operation is then converted into a hexadecimal string using `byteHex()`.
- Finally, an encrypted string is built from the hexadecimal codes and returned by `crypt()`.

It's worth mentioning that this is a very basic encryption and is not suitable for high-security applications. For stronger encryption, consider using secure encryption libraries.

# decrypt

a function named `decrypt` that decrypts an encoded input string using a salt. Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the code:

- The decrypt function is defined with two parameters, `salt` and `encoded`. `salt` is a string that's used to modify the output when applied to the encoded text, and `encoded` is the string that needs to be decrypted.

- Inside the `decrypt` function, there are three other helper functions defined:

   1. `textToChars` - it accepts a string, then splits that string into individual characters and maps them to their corresponding ASCII values using `charCodeAt(0)`. 
   
   2. `applySaltToChar` - it accepts a code (ASCII value of char), returns a new code which is XOR of all ASCII values of `salt` and input code.
   
- The function then begins to decrypt the encoded string by:

   1. Breaking the `encoded` string into array of two characters using the `match` method with regex `/.{1,2}/g`. This regex tells the match method to form groups of exactly 2 characters. 

   2. Then, using `map`, it converts each group of two characters from hexadecimal to decimal representation using `parseInt(hex, 16)`.

   3. It then applies the `applySaltToChar` to each decimal number. The `reduce` function performed apply XOR operation with each character's ASCII of salt.

   4. Then, using `map` again, it converts each decimal number to string representation using `String.fromCharCode(charCode)`. 

   5. Finally, it joins back all the characters into a single string using `join("")`.

The functionality of this code is a basic encryption/decryption method which relies on XOR operation. The encryption strength entirely relies on the `salt` used. If the `salt` is unknown, it will be hard to decrypt the encoded (encrypted) text. However, if the `salt` is known, the decryption can be performed easily.

# datetime

 two classes, `Time` and `Date`, as well as some helper functions.

1. **`Time` class:** This class represents a specific point in time. It has two properties: `hour` and `minute`. There are four methods in this class: `toString()`, `toStamp()`, and a static method named `fromStamp()`. 

   -  `toString()`: Converts the object to a string representation. It uses the helper function `serializeTime()` to achieve this. If a `Time` object has `hour` and `minute` values as `2` and `30`, the method would return a string `"02:30"`. 

   -  `toStamp()`: Converts the hours and minutes of the `Time` object into total minutes. For instance, if a `Time` object has `2` hours and `30` minutes, this function will return `150`. 

   -  `fromStamp(stamp: number)`: This static method creates a new `Time` object by taking an integer stamp representing total minutes, and converting it into hours and minutes using the `dayjs` library.

2. **`Date` class:** This class represents a date. It has three properties: `day`, `month` and `year`. Like the `Time` class, this class has four methods: `toString()`, `toStamp()`, and a static method named `fromStamp()`.

   -  `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the `Date` object using the `serializeDate()` helper function.

   -  `toStamp()`: Converts the `Date` object into the number of days from '1970-01-01' to the specified date using the `dayjs` library.

   -  `fromStamp(stamp: number)`: This static method takes an integer stamp representing total days since '1970-01-01' and returns a new `Date` object representing the specific date.

3. Several helper functions are provided for parsing (converting string to object), serializing (converting object to string), and stamping (converting object to total minutes or total days), such as `parseDate()`, `serializeDate()`, `dateStamp()`, `parseTime()`, `serializeTime()` and `timeStamp()`. 

4. There are two functions `currentDate()` and `currentTime()` which return the current date and time as a serialized string respectively.

It's worth noting that this code also uses [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) (`DATE_EXPR` and `TIME_EXPR`) to enforce a certain date and time format. The `dayjs` library is also used to manipulate and format dates and times.

# deepClone

a deep cloning function. This function creates a copy of the given object such that changes to the original object won't affect the copy and vice versa. A deep clone means copying everything including complex references like sub-arrays and sub-objects, as opposed to a shallow clone which may share references to complex types. 

Here is what each part of the function does:

- `export const deepClone = (src: any) => { }`: 
This is the function declaration that includes an export statement, meaning it can be imported and used in other modules. The function `deepClone` takes one input `src` which is described as of type `any`. The `any` type here is a placeholder for any type that TypeScript supports.

- `const target: any = {};`: 
This creates an empty object `target` that will be populated to become an exact copy of `src`.

- `for (const prop in (src as any)) { }`: 
This is a for-in loop that iterates over each property ('prop') in the source object.

- `if (src.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { }`: 
This if statement ensures that only the object's own properties (not inherited ones) are cloned.

- `if (Array.isArray(src[prop])) { }`:
This checks if the currently evaluated property is an array.

- `target[prop] = src[prop].slice(0);`:
If the property is an array, a shallow copy of it is made using the `slice` method and set to the corresponding property in the target object.

- `else if (isObject(src[prop])) { }`:
If the property is not an array, it checks whether the property is an object.

- `target[prop] = deepClone(src[prop]);`:
If the property is an object, the function calls itself recursively to copy over nested objects.

- `else { target[prop] = src[prop]; }`:
If the property is neither an array nor object, it is directly assigned to the corresponding property in the target object.

One important thing to note here is that the function seems to mention in the comments (/* TODO: нет поддержки копирования массивов объектов */) that it does not currently support cloning arrays of objects.

The separate `isObject` function that is imported at the bottom appears to be a utility function that presumably checks whether a given value is an object. As it's not included in your post, I cannot be certain about its implementation, but typically these functions check whether a value is not `null` and whether its `typeof` equals `"object"`.

# deepCompare

a utility function and a part of a React class component.

1. `deepCompare` function: 

This function is used to deeply compare two objects. It takes two parameters `obj1` and `obj2`. The purpose is to find out whether these two objects are identical or not. This is different from the `===` operator, which only checks if the two variables point to the same memory location, rather than checking if they have the same structure and values.

Here’s what happens in a nutshell:

- if `obj1` and `obj2` are identical by reference or both are `null` or `undefined`, return `true`, as they are the same
- if both `obj1` and `obj2` are objects (of any type, arrays, functions, etc.), then the function moves on to the next set of rules
- if the number of keys (properties and methods) of `obj1` and `obj2` is different, return `false`, because they have to be the same
- for each key in `obj1`, call the deep comparison function again (recursion) with the values of `obj1[key]` and `obj2[key]`
- if any deep-comparison returns `false`, return `false` immediately, as that means they are not deeply equal
- if the loop finishes without finding any non-equal parts, return `true`

If the `isObject` utility function (which isn't provided in the code) determines that either `obj1` or `obj2` are not of the object type, it will return `false`.

2. `shouldComponentUpdate` function 

This is a lifecycle method of the Component `AutoSizer`. It is used to let React know if a component's output is not affected by the current change in state or props, thus avoiding unnecessary rerenders for performance optimization.

In this function, it first checks whether the state-related conditions are changed or not using the previous and next state. If they are changed, then it will return `true`. If not, it checks for prop-related conditions using deep comparison for complex object props with the previously discussed `deepCompare` function. If any deep-comparison returns `false`, the function will return `true`, signaling that the component should update.

3. `IAutoSizerProps` interface 

This defines the expected properties for the AutoSizer component.

4. `State` type

This type represents the state values of an object with specific parameters such as height, width, childHeight, and childWidth,

5. Jest tests 

The given Jest tests demonstrate example usages of the `deepCompare` function in a testing scenario.

6. `private _patchSizeRequest` function 

This method is used to set the values of the last height request and last width request based on the passed properties. This function is often useful where we have to manage some internal component behavior based on prop values.

These elements together, along with the numerous imported modules, make up a complex application involving deeply compared objects, rendering logic based on changing prop and state values, and deep cloning of objects.

# deepFlat

`deepFlat` in your TypeScript code is a utility that helps to deeply flatten an array of objects. 

**Here is a breakdown of its functionality:**

1.  The function `deepFlat` is declared with a generic type parameter `T` which defaults to `any`. The argument it takes is of type `T[]` (an array of `T` items) and defaults to an empty array if not provided. The function returns an array of the type `T`.

```typescript
export const deepFlat = <T = any>(arr: T[] = []) => { ... };
```

2. Inside the function, an empty array `result` is initialized to collect the final flattened items. 

3. The `process` function is the actual part of `deepFlat` that does the recursive flattening. The function `process` takes an array of entries as an argument. It operates on each entry of the array in the following ways:
   - It tries to grab 'fields' and 'child' properties from the current entry. 
   - If the 'child' property exists, it is converted into a single item array.
   - The function then calls `process` recursively on the combination of 'fields' and 'child' items, resulting in a depth-first traversal pattern.
   - After handling nested items, the current item is added to the `result` array.

```typescript
const process = (entries: any[] = []) => entries?.forEach((entry) => { 
    const fields = entry['fields'] || [];
    const child = entry['child'] ? [ entry['child'] ] : [];
    process([...fields, ...child]);
    result.push(entry);
});
```

4. Initially, `process` is called with the input array to start off the deep flattening.

5. Once the recusive calls to `process` are complete, the function returns the `result` array which contains all the nested items in a flattened form.

The imported code snippets for `deepFlat`, `FieldType`, and `TypedField` are used in the unit tests where the `deepFlat` function is used with different types of nested field structures and verified for correct flattening using expect statements.

```typescript
expect(deepFlat(fields50).length).toBe(50);
expect(deepFlat(fields32).length).toBe(32);
expect(deepFlat(fields19).length).toBe(19);
expect(deepFlat(fields3).length).toBe(3);
expect(deepFlat(fields4).length).toBe(4);
```

Please note, the function is built on the assumption that the objects in the arrays have 'fields' (an array) and 'child' (an object) properties. This is valid for the types `FieldType` and `TypedField` as per the unit tests. If used with objects that do not adhere to these criteria, the function might not behave as expected.

# deepMerge


The `deepMerge` function merges multiple objects into one recursively. This function takes a target, which is the object to merge into, and one or more source objects that are to be merged from.

The function is defined using TypeScript, and `any` is used as a type for the target as well as the source objects, which means that the arguments can be of any type but, logically, should be objects for this operation.

```typescript
export const deepMerge = (target: any, ...sources: any[]): any => {
```

If the sources array is empty, then it simply returns the target, otherwise it shifts (extracts and removes) the first object from sources and assigns it to the `source` variable.

```typescript
    if (!sources.length) return target;
    const source = sources.shift();
```

If both the target and source are objects, then it loops over the properties of the source object.

```typescript
    if (isObject(target) && isObject(source)) {
```

Inside the loop, if the property's value from the source object is an array, it copies this array into the target object, else if it's an object, it recursively calls the `deepMerge` function with the corresponding property of the target object and the source object.

If it’s not an object (thus, a primitive value), it assigns this property's value from the source to the target object.

```typescript
        for (const key in source) {
            if (Array.isArray(source[key])) {
                target[key] = source[key].slice(0);
            } else if (isObject(source[key])) {
                if (!target[key]) Object.assign(target, { [key]: {} });
                deepMerge(target[key], source[key]);
            } else {
                Object.assign(target, { [key]: source[key] });
            }
        }
```

At the end of the function, it calls itself recursively with the target and the remaining source objects in the `sources` array, or else if no objects are left, it returns the merged object.

```typescript
    return deepMerge(target, ...sources);
};
```

This function is useful for deep cloning objects or merging multiple objects into one. If conflicting properties are found in objects, the last source object's property's value is used. Properties won't be just shallow copied but will be deep copied thanks to recursion usage.

It's important to note that this function relies on an `isObject` function that is not provided in this code snippet, but in a different module as indicated in the import statement. This `isObject` function is assumed to determine whether a given argument is an object.

```typescript
import isObject from './isObject';
```

# downloadBlank

The given TypeScript function `downloadBlank()` is designed to download a file from a specified URL with a given file name. It's used in the context of a web application, and this function would be running in the browser.

Here is a breakdown of the function and its behavior:

1. It accepts two parameters, `url` and `name`, which are both of type `string`. The `url` is the file location and `name` is the name to be given to the downloaded file.

2. At the start of the function, it checks if `overrideRef` is defined. If so, it calls the function `overrideRef` with `url` and `name` as arguments, and then terminates the function. This can be used to substitute the standard download behavior with custom logic. But `overrideRef` is not defined in this provided code, so we can't go deep into its behavior.

3. If `overrideRef` is not defined, the function proceeds to download the file from the provided `url`. It does this by calling the built-in Fetch API's `fetch` method with `url` and the options object `{ mode: 'no-cors' }`. The `mode: 'no-cors'` option allows for "opaque" responses which do not affect security but can't be inspected (they mostly contain useless data for JavaScript and can't really be used).

4. After the request is made, the function then transforms the response to a Blob using the `response.blob()` method.

5. The Blob is then processed further:
    - Its type is determined using the `fileTypeFromBlob` function imported from "file-type/core" (this function is not implemented in the provided code, but it's part of an npm package called `file-type` that can detect a file's type based on its content).
    - A new Blob is created using the original Blob and the determined type. If the type couldn't be determined, the original Blob's type is used instead.

6. After creating the new Blob, the function creates a `Blob URL` for it using `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`.

7. An anchor (`a` element) is then created in the document with the `Blob URL` as its `href` attribute, the passed file `name` as its download attribute, and the style set to `display: none`. The `target` attribute is set to `_blank` to ensure that the file download happens in a new browser tab or window.

8. The `a` element is added to the document and, before it's clicked programmatically to initiate the download, an event listener is set up to clean up the `Blob URL` after the click. This is done using `queueMicrotask` to make sure the revocation of the `Blob URL` happens after the download.

9. Finally, the `a` element is clicked programmatically (via `a.click()`), triggering the download of the file in a new browser tab or window.

This function does not return any value as it's more about performing an action (downloading a file from a given URL). Any errors during this process (like network errors or Fetch API errors) would likely cause a rejected Promise, which isn't handled here and would need to be caught and handled where this function is called.

# errorData


This TypeScript code defines a function named `errorData`. This function takes an Error object as input and returns an object.

```typescript
export const errorData = (error: Error) => {
    ...
};
```

The first thing this function does is to get all of the property names from the Error object. It does this using Object.getOwnPropertyNames(), which returns an array of all properties found directly upon a given object. 

```typescript
const propertyNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(error);
```

Next, it prepares an empty object named `result` which will be populated with the enumerable properties of the Error object, and returned at the end.

```typescript
const result = {};
```

A forEach() method is then used to iterate over each of these property names.

```typescript
propertyNames.forEach((property) => {
  ...
})
```

Inside this loop, on each iteration, it gets the property descriptor for the current property using Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(). This method returns a property descriptor for an own property (that is, one directly present on an object and not in the object's prototype chain) of a given object. 

```typescript
const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(error, property) || {};
```

It then checks if this property descriptor has a 'value' property and if it does, it adds this value to the result object with the same property name.

```typescript
if ('value' in descriptor) {
    result[property] = descriptor.value;
}
```

Finally, it returns the result object, which now contains all the enumerable properties from the Error object.

```typescript
return result;
```
This function essentially extracts the information from the Error object in a way that it can be easily used or stored. It helps to clean up and normalize error data for further processing or logging.

# fetchApi

a wrapper for the Fetch API, used to make HTTP requests. The purpose of the `fetchApi` function is to provide an easy-to-use async function that throws a custom `FetchError` when any error occurs during the request. This custom error includes additional details about the failed request, such as the original error, the request details, and the response (if any).

Let's break down the `fetchApi` function:

```typescript
export const fetchApi = async <T = any>(input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit): Promise<T> => {
```
The above declares an async function called `fetchApi`. The function is generic, with a default type of `any`. This means when you call `fetchApi`, you can specify the expected type of the response like `fetchApi<YourType>(...)`. If you don't specify a type, it will return a promise that resolves with any value.

```typescript
const request = input instanceof URL ? input.toString() : input;
```
This line checks if the `input` is an instance of the `URL` class. If it is, `input.toString()` is used as the request; otherwise, `input` is used as it is.

The following code builds the request options to pass to the `fetch` call, including headers:

```typescript
let response: Response | undefined = undefined;
try {
    response = await fetch(request, {
        ...init,
        headers: {
            ...(PAYLOAD_METHODS.includes(init?.method?.toUpperCase()) && {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            }),
            ...init?.headers,
        },
    });
```
It first sets up a variable to hold the response, with an initial value of `undefined`.

Then, it uses the `fetch` API function to make the request, passing our `request` and `init` information to it. The `headers` option is deeply merged and extended with the provided `init.headers` and, if the HTTP method allows for the inclusion of a payload, a `Content-Type` of `application/json`.

If the fetch call is unsuccessful, meaning the response does not have an `ok` status, we throw an Error:

```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('fetchApi response not ok');
}
return await response.json();
```
If the fetch call is successful (`response.ok` is true), the function converts the response into JSON using `response.json()`. This is an async operation and returns a `Promise`.

Finally, if an error occurs at any point during the process, the function catches it and throws a `FetchError`, which includes the original error, request details, and response details (if any):

```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
    throw new FetchError(
        error,
        request,
        response,
    );
}
```

In the provided `FetchError` class, this is an extension of the default `Error` class. In addition to the standard error message, it retains key details of the fetch operation that failed to support easier debugging.

# filterString

a function `filterString` that removes specific strings from a given data string. 

```typescript
/**
 * Removes specified strings from a given data string.
 *
 * @param data - The target data string to filter.
 * @param ignore - The strings to be removed from the data string.
 * @returns - The filtered data string with specified strings removed.
 */
export const filterString = (data: string, ...ignore: string[]) => {
    let items = data;
    for (const entry of ignore) {
        items = items.split(entry).join('');
    }
    return items;
};
```

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- The function takes two parameters. The first parameter `data` is a string that is the target from which specific strings should be removed. The second parameter `ignore` is an array of strings that should be removed from the `data` string.

- The `...` in front of the `ignore` parameter indicates that the function uses the rest parameter syntax, which allows it to accept any number of arguments.

- Inside the function, a `for` loop iterates over the `ignore` array. For each string in the `ignore` array, the code splits the `items` string into an array at each occurrence of the `ignore` string, effectively removing it, then rejoins the array back into a string.

- The function finally returns the filtered string which no longer includes any occurrence of the strings that needed to be ignored.

- The function is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the application.

Take note that this is a pure function in that for given inputs, it will always produce the same output and does not modify the values outside of its scope.

# flatArray

The flatArray function accepts one or more arrays and returns a new array that is a flat (single-level) version of the input arrays. It uses the .flat() method of the Array object, which creates a new array with all subarray elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth. Here, the depth is set to Infinity, indicating that the input arrays should be flattened regardless of how nested they are.

# formatAmount

a function named `formatAmount` that formats numerical values with a specific scale (decimal places) and separates the thousands in the integer part with a separator.

The function `formatAmount` has three parameters:

1. `value` (required): A `number` or `string` that will be formatted. The function will convert this value to a `number`.

2. `scale` (optional): An integer representing the number of decimal places to show for the number. The default value is `2` if this argument is not provided.

3. `separator` (optional): A `string` used as the separator for thousands. The default value is `,` if this argument is not provided.

The function works as follows:

1. Convert the `value` to a `number` and format it to the specified `scale` (number of decimal places) using the `toFixed` method of the `Number` object. This result is stored in the `str` constant.

2. Check if the numerical `value` is less than `10000`. If it is, the formatted string `str` is returned as it is. If it's not, a regex replace operation is executed to insert a thousands separator. The regular expression `/(\\d)(?=(\\d{3})+(\\.|$))/g` matches every position between two digits where the following digits' count is a multiple of three (counting from right to left excluding the decimal).

    The replacing string `$1${nbsp}` refers to 1st captured group (the digit before the matched position) followed by a non-breakable space character (nbsp). It's used to separate thousands.

3. Finally, it replaces the trailing ".00" in the resulting string (if any) using the regular expression `/.00$/`, and replaces the decimal point with the specified `separator`.

The function then returns the final formatted string.

This function could be used to format currency amounts, for example.

# formatStr

a function called `formatStr`. This function is used to replace placeholders in a string with corresponding values passed to the function.

Let's breakdown the code:

- `export const formatStr = (str: string, ...args: (string | number | boolean)[])`: The function `formatStr` is declared and exported. The function takes two parameters. The first is `str`, the input string which contains placeholders. The second is `args`, which is an array that can contain elements of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. The `...` before `args` indicates a rest parameter, meaning any number of arguments can be passed to the function after the `str` argument.

- `let i = -1;`: The variable `i` is declared and initialized to -1. `i` will be used to incrementally access elements from the `args` array.

- `return str.replace(/{\d}|{}/g, (match) => { ... } );`: The function uses `replace()` function on string `str` with a callback function as second parameter. The `replace()` call uses a regular expression to match either a placeholder with a digit `{}`, or without any digit `{}`. Each matched placeholder will call the callback function, in which operations for placeholder replacement will be conducted.

- The callback function in the `replace()` call determines what the placeholder should be replaced with. The `match` parameter in the callback function represents the matched placeholder. Each time a match is found `i` is incremented.

- If `match` is `{}`, then the corresponding element in `args` is selected by index `i`, converted to a string and used as the replacement. If the element does not exist (is `undefined`), an empty string is used as the replacement.

- If `match` is `{\d}` (meaning it contains a digit), then the callback function extracts the digit, uses it as an index to find the corresponding replacement in `args`, converts it to string and uses it as the replacement. If the element does not exist (is `undefined`), an empty string is used as the replacement.

An example usage of the function is provided in the JSDoc comments: `formatStr("hello {1} world {0} foo {}", 1, 2, 3)` would return `"hello 2 world 1 foo 3"`. The placeholders `{1}`, `{0}`, and `{}` are replaced with the corresponding elements in `args`, which are `2`, `1`, and `3` respectively.

# formatText

a utility function named `formatText` which takes a raw string and a template string, and formats the raw string according to patterns provided in the template. Additionally, an optional `params` parameter can be used to specify various customization options. 

The function `formatText` is declared with argument typing as follows:

- `raw: string` - The raw string to be formatted.
- `template: string` - The template string used for formatting.
- `params: IParams` - Optional parameters for customization which has a default value as an empty object.


The `IParams` interface is the type used for the `params` argument and has the following properties:

- `symbol?: string` - The symbol used in the template to indicate characters to be replaced.
- `allowed?: RegExp | ((char: string, idx: number) => boolean)` - A function or regular expression used to filter characters in the raw string.
- `replace?: (char: string) => string | null` - A function used to replace characters in the raw string.

In `formatText`, the symbol is destructured from params object and set to '0' by default if it's not provided.

The function first checks if the template or raw are falsy, if this is the case, the raw string is returned immediately. This check prevents unnecessary computations in case the input data are not useful.

Then it checks whether a replacement function is provided. If so, it applies this function to every character in `raw`, replacing the character with the result of the function.

Next, if an `allowed` filter is provided (either as a function or regular expression), any characters in `raw` which do not pass the filter are removed.

Finally, it formats the raw string according to the template. It goes through every character in the template. If current template character matches the symbol or match the character in raw string at the same index, it replaces/template it with the raw string character. This operation continue until all characters in the raw string are exhausted.

This function returns a formatted string based on the template and `raw` string, where specific characters in the template are replaced with characters from the raw string.

Regarding specific case question, the `formatText` function is imported and used in normalizeText function in normalization of a text string. It's also suggesting that this function can be imported in other files and used as a utility function to format a raw string based on a template string.

# get

a utility function written in TypeScript, named `get`.

This function declares two parameters:
1. `object`: This parameter denotes an object from which we want to retrieve a value.
2. `path`: This parameter specifies the path to the desired value in the object, either as an array or a dot-separated string.

The function dynamically sequences through an object to retrieve a nested value based on a given path and returns the value at the specified path or `undefined` if it doesn't exist.

Let's break down the steps :

1. It first checks if the `path` is an array. If it's an array, it uses the `path` as it is, otherwise it splits the `path` string by '.' to generate an array of keys which represent the path to the given property.

2. Then, `flatMap` is used to flatten the paths (if the paths are in nested structure). The function checks each part of the array, if it's a string, it splits by '.' (to handle the case where a nested path is given as a string), else it passes the part with no change. The result is a flat array of keys representing the access path to the desired value in the object.

3. Then, the `reduce` function is called on `pathArrayFlat` with an initial value of `object`. In the `reduce` function, for each key in the array, the value of the current object `obj` for the current key is retrieved. The `&&` operator ensures that if at any point `obj` is `undefined` (meaning a key was not in the object), the function will return `undefined` for that and all subsequent keys.

4. Finally, the function returns the found value, or `undefined` if it was not found at the specified path.

This technique is often used in dynamic property access of nested structures in JavaScript and TypeScript, where the exact path to a property is not known until runtime and might vary over different objects.

For example, using this function on an object `obj = {a: {b: {c: 2}}}` with a path of 'a.b.c' or ['a', 'b', 'c'] would return the value 2, since that is the value at that path in the object. If a path does not exist in the object, the function will return `undefined`.

# getAvailableFields

the function `getAvailableFields` which aims to filter and construct a list of available fields. The availability of fields is based on certain conditions which involve provided features, the data and payload objects.

Here's an explanation of the function:

1. The `getAvailableFields` function takes four parameters:

- `fields`: An array of fields which we might assume to be some form of data entities defined by the `IField` interface.
- `data`: A data object where keys are strings, and values can be anything.
- `payload`: A payload object where keys are strings, and values can be anything.
- `_features`: Optional features collected from the `features` property of the `IOnePublicProps` interface. This parameter is optional.

2. It first calls the function `resolveFeatures` with `_features` as argument, which transforms the `_features` into a usable form.

3. It then applies a `filter` function on the `fields` array and passes the resulting array along with `data` and `payload` objects into the `buildCommonResult` function.

The filter function iterates over each field and checks if a field should be included in the final list or not.

    - If the `field` doesn't have `features` or any of the `features` required by the `field` is already included in the main `features`, it allows the `field` to pass through the filter, i.e., the `field` is available.
    - The filtered list only includes the fields that have at least one feature that matches with the main features, or fields that do not require any features.

4. The `buildCommonResult` function constructed from the filtered list has two parts: 

- `visible`: fields that are visible and eligible based on the specified conditions.
- `hidden`: fields that are not eligible and hence, hidden.

5. The `getAvailableFields` finally returns this constructed object from `buildCommonResult` function. 

Remember that this explanation is based on assumptions and inspection of the provided code. The actual intention of this function may vary based on business logic or other factors.

# getElementFromXPath

`getElementFromXPath`, is designed to retrieve the first HTML element that matches a specified XPath expression.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves the first element matching the given XPath expression.
 *
 * @param xpath - The XPath expression to match the element(s).
 * @returns - The first element that matches the XPath expression, or null if no match is found.
 */
export const getElementFromXPath = (xpath: string) =>
    document.evaluate(
        xpath,
        document,
        null,
        XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE,
        null
    ).singleNodeValue;
```

The function takes one parameter, `xpath`, which is a string representing the XPath expression that is to be matched against the document's elements.

The function uses the `evaluate` method from the `document` object. 

- The first argument `xpath` is the XPath expression.
- The second argument is the context node against which the expression is executed - in this case, it's the entire document.
- The third argument is a resolver function for any namespace prefixes in the XPath expression - here it is `null`, implying no namespace prefixes are expected.
- The fourth argument `XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE`, means the result will be the first node that matches the XPath expression, in document order.
- The fifth argument is an existing result object to reuse for the document - in this case, it is `null` indicating that a new result object will be created.

Finally, the `.singleNodeValue` property is used, which will return the first element that matches the XPath expression. If no match is found, `null` will be returned.

# getErrorMessage

a function called `getErrorMessage` which is designed to gather error message information from an error object of any type. 

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- It starts by setting a default `errorMessage` of 'Unknown error'.
- If the `error` object is a string, it assumes the entire string is the error message.
- If the `error` object is an object and not null, it checks for the existence of an error message in several places, namely `error.error.message`, `error.data.message`, and `error.message`. If it finds an error message in one of these places, it updates the `errorMessage`.
- After all the checks, it returns the final `errorMessage`.

This function is useful because error messages can be passed in different ways depending on the type of error thrown and the library/api returning the error. It minimizes the chance of missing important error information when handling exceptions in a generic way.

The `getErrorMessage` function is exported, which means it can be imported in other parts of the application as you shown in one of your examples:

```typescript
import getErrorMessage from "../utils/getErrorMessage";
```

The various interfaces you provided such as `IProcess`, `IParams`, `IState` and `IError` are unrelated to the provided `getErrorMessage` function as they are not referenced in it. Similarly, the `getPercent` function is not directly related to the `getErrorMessage` function, although it may be used elsewhere in your application.

# getFilterCount

`getFilterCount`, is used to count the number of non-empty and non-ignored key-value pairs in a given filter data object.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

- The function has two parameters:
  1. `filterData`, which is of type `Record<string, unknown>`. This is the object to filter.
  2. `ignore`, which is a function that takes a string and any value as arguments and returns a boolean. This function is intended to decide whether a given key-value pair in the `filterData` object should be ignored when counting the non-empty values. If not provided, the default function used always returns false, meaning no key-value pairs are ignored.

- The `counter` variable is initialized at `0` and will be used to count the non-empty and non-ignored key-value pairs.

- The function iterates over the `filterData` object with a `for...of` loop, using each key in the object.

   - If the value matched with a key in `filterData` is `null`, an empty string, or `false`, iteration continues with the next key. Therefore, such values aren't counted.
   
   - If the `ignore` function, when called with the current key and its corresponding value, returns `true`, the function likewise skips to the next iteration. Again, in this case, the key-value pair isn't counted.

- If none of the previous conditions are met, the `counter` is incremented by `1`.

- Once all key-value pairs have been processed, the `counter` value (representing the total number of non-empty and non-ignored key-value pairs in the `filterData` object) is returned.

Here, `const keys = Object.keys(filterData || {});` gets an array of all keys in `filterData`. If `filterData` is `null` or `undefined`, an empty object is used as the backup, resulting in an empty array.

# getInitialData

a function named `getInitialData` that generates initial data based on provided field definitions and a payload. The function is exported for usage in other modules/files.

- The function is generic. It uses two placeholders for types, `Data` and `Payload`. `Data` represents the structure of the data object to be created while `Payload` is the structure of the payload for assigned defaults.

- The function accepts two arguments: an array of field definitions `fields` and a payload `payload` to be used for assigning default values to the fields. If no payload is provided, an empty object `{}` is used by default.

- Inside the function, it initially creates an empty object `newData` which will hold the generated initial data.

- The function `deepFlat(fields)` is called to flatten the `fields` array. It presumably takes a nested array and returns a single-level array.

- This flattened array is then filtered to only include fields with a name.

- The function traverses these fields using `forEach`, using destructuring to extract properties of each field: `type`, `name`, `defaultValue`, and `hidden`.

- A field is created in `newData` with the `name` by calling the `create` function.

- Conditions are then checked to determine the value to be set for each field in `newData`.

  - If `hidden` is a function that, when invoked with the payload, returns a truthy value, or if `hidden` itself is a truthy value, the field is skipped.

  - Otherwise, if the `defaultValue` of the field is `undefined`, the value of the field is set to either an existing value in `newData` at the `name` path, or the value returned by `initialValue(type)` if no existing value is found.

  - If `defaultValue` is a function, it's invoked with the `payload` argument and the result is set as the value of the field.

  - If `defaultValue` is neither `undefined` nor a function, it's directly set as the value of the field.

- Finally, `newData` is returned after being type-casted to `Data`.

The implementation details of the functions `create`, `set`, `get`, `initialValue`, and `deepFlat` are not provided, so we can only assume their behavior based on their usage in the provided code.

# getMediaContext

It contains a function named `getMediaContext` which helps determine the type of medium a device falls into based on the width of the device's screen.

The function accepts an optional parameter, a set of breakpoints encapsulated in an object that matches the `IBreakpoints` interface. Each property value in this interface represents a specific milestone in screen width typically used in Responsive Design.

```typescript
interface IBreakpoints {
  xs: number;
  sm: number;
  md: number;
  lg: number;
  xl: number;
}
```

This object can contain values for `xs` (extra small), `sm` (small), `md` (medium), `lg` (large), and `xl` (extra-large). If the object is not provided, the function has some default values it will use.

In the `getMediaContext` implementation, the `match` function is used to determine whether or not the current window's innerWidth fits within a certain range.

```typescript
const match = (from: number, to: number) =>
  window.innerWidth >= from && window.innerWidth < to;
```

The match function is a simple boolean function that validates if the current window's width is between or equals the `from` and `to` params.

Finally, `getMediaContext` returns an object that represents the medium in which the device is being classified, indicating whether the device is a phone, tablet, desktop, wide-screen, or mobile.

```typescript
return {
  isPhone,
  isTablet,
  isDesktop,
  isWide: isTablet || isDesktop,
  isMobile: isPhone,
};
```

This approach to system design is often utilized in web development to provide an optimal browsing experience for devices of various display sizes.

# getMomentStamp

This function calculates the moment stamp based on the given end date and a specified dimension. This is achieved using functionality from the "dayjs" library, which is used for manipulating dates and times in JavaScript.

# fromMomentStamp

The provided TypeScript code exports a function called `fromMomentStamp` which is essentially used for converting a given timestamp into a specific moment in time using the `dayjs` library.

The `fromMomentStamp` function takes two arguments:
1. `stamp`: A number (presumably a Unix timestamp).
2. `dimension`: A `dayjs.ManipulateType`. This is a type from the `dayjs` library, which can be a string such as 'year', 'month', 'week', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'millisecond', or their plural forms. If no value is provided for `dimension`, it will default to the value of `DIMENSION` (presumably a string constant that is not shown in the given code).

Inside the function, the `dayjs` function is called with `GENESIS` as its argument. `GENESIS` is presumably a certain moment in time, serving as a base or start point (this constant is not shown in the given code). The `.add()` method is called on the result, with `stamp` and `dimension` as its arguments. This will add the `stamp` to the `GENESIS` moment in time, in the units specified by `dimension`.

The function returns the resulting `dayjs` object, which represents the moment in time corresponding to the added timestamp.

# getRouteItem

The function iterates over each route item in the provided array and checks if the current route's path (defaulting to "/" if not present) matches the provided pathname by compiling the path into a regular expression with `pathToRegexp` method. If a match is found, the function stops iterating and returns the current route. If no match is found for any route, it returns null.

# getRouteParams

`getRouteParams` is a function that retrieves route parameters from a given pathname based on a set of routes. 

This function uses generic type `T = Record<string, any>` to allow any type of object to be used as parameters. It receives two arguments - `routes` which is an array of `ISwitchItem` routes and `pathname` which is the path to extract parameters from.

```typescript
export const getRouteParams = <T = Record<string, any>>(routes: ISwitchItem[], pathname: string): T | null => {
    for (const { path } of routes) {
        // ...
    }
};
```

Inside the function, it loops over each item in the `routes` array and creates an empty object `params` of type `T`. 

For each `route` it uses the `pathToRegexp` function to create a `reg` regular expression of the `path`. If `pathname` does match this regular expression, the matching `tokens` from the `pathname` are extracted and each token is assigned to the corresponding key name in `params`.

```typescript
const params = {} as T;
const keys: Key[] = [];
const reg = pathToRegexp(path, keys);
const match = reg.test(pathname);
if (match) {
    const tokens = reg.exec(pathname);
    tokens && keys.forEach((key, i) => {
        params[key.name] = tokens[i + 1];
    });
    return params;
}
```

If there is no matching route in `routes` for the given `pathname`, the function returns `null`.

The function `getRouteParams` is used in the `RouteManager` class, where it fills the `_params` field with the relevant parameters of the current route. 

```typescript
this._params = getRouteParams<T>(routes, location.pathname);
```

In conclusion, the function `getRouteParams` is a utility function in a routing system that extracts and returns an object filled with the parameters of a URL pathname based on a defined set of routes or returns null if no parameters are found.

# getTimeStamp

The function `getTimeStamp` takes one optional argument `source` which defaults to the current date and time if nothing is provided. This is achieved by using the `dayjs()` function, which is imported from the `dayjs` library.

Within this function, two variables, `hour` and `minute`, are declared and assigned the values of the hour and minute of `source`.

The `source.get("hour")` and `source.get("minute")` are methods from the `dayjs` library that retrieve the hour and minute, respectively, from the `source` date.

Finally, the function returns the total minutes calculated by this formula `hour * 60 + minute`. This effectively calculates the timestamp in minutes of the source date and time.


# fromTimeStamp

`fromTimeStamp`, converts a timestamp to a date and time utilizing the `dayjs` library.

The function takes one parameter, `stamp`:
- `stamp` (type: `number`): This is the timestamp you want to convert.

The function returns the date and time that corresponds to the given timestamp.

Here's how it works:
- A `genesis` constant is defined which represents the current date and time, but the hour and minute are set to 0. This essentially represents the start of the current day.
- The function then adds the number of minutes represented by `stamp` to `genesis` using the `add` method of the `dayjs` library.

The `dayjs` library is used for all date-time operations.
Dayjs is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.

The `set` method is used to set a specific part (like hour, minute, etc.) of a Day.js object.

Here's the entire code along with the import of dayjs:

```typescript
import dayjs from "dayjs";

/**
 * Converts a timestamp to a date and time using dayjs library.
 * @param stamp - The timestamp to convert.
 * @returns The date and time corresponding to the given timestamp.
 */
export const fromTimeStamp = (stamp: number) => {
  const genesis = dayjs().set("hour", 0).set("minute", 0);
  return genesis.add(stamp, "minute");
};
```

# getXPathFromElement

`getXPathFromElement`, is used to get the XPath of a given HTML element. 

XPath, or XML Path Language, is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document. In the context of this function, it is used to find the location of a specific HTML element in the web document.

Now, let's break down the function:

- It has one parameter: `element`, which should be an instance of the `HTMLElement` interface.

- The function returns either a string value (the XPath of the element) or `null`.

- If the supplied HTML element's tag name is "HTML", it returns the string "/HTML[1]". This indicates that the "HTML" element is the root of the XPath.

- If the supplied HTML element is the "BODY" of the document, it returns the string "/HTML[1]/BODY[1]". This displays the path to the "BODY" element.

- Otherwise, the function creates a `siblings` array that contains all the child nodes of the element's parent node.

- Then, it iterates through the `siblings` array and performs two actions:
  - If the current sibling in the loop is the same as the `element` itself and `element` has a parent node, it navigates up the tree (recursively calling `getXPathFromElement` with the parent element) and appends the element's tag name and its index among its siblings to the XPath string.
  - If a `sibling` has a nodeType of 1, indicating it is an element node, and its tag name is the same as the `element`'s tag name, then the function increments `ix` by 1. This essentially counts the number of same-typed siblings before our element to find its index.

- If no XPath can be derived (i.e., the element is not part of the document tree), the function will return `null`.

Here is the mentioned function once again for your reference:

```typescript
/**
 * Get the XPath of a given HTML element.
 *
 * @param element - The HTML element to get the XPath from.
 * @returns - The XPath of the element, or null if it couldn't be determined.
 */
export const getXPathFromElement = (element: HTMLElement): string | null => {
    if (element.tagName == "HTML") return "/HTML[1]";
    if (element === document.body) return "/HTML[1]/BODY[1]";
    let ix = 0;
    const siblings = element.parentNode?.childNodes || [];
    for (let i = 0; i < siblings.length; i++) {
      const sibling = siblings[i] as HTMLElement;
      if (sibling === element && element.parentNode)
        return (
          getXPathFromElement(element.parentNode as HTMLElement) +
          "/" +
          element.tagName +
          "[" +
          (ix + 1) +
          "]"
        );
      if (sibling.nodeType === 1 && sibling.tagName === element.tagName) ix++;
    }
    return null;
};
```
Please note that the XPath generated by this function is 1-indexed, as per XPath standard.


# heavy

a function `heavy` that does lazy loading of a React component with suspense. This behaviour allows you to defer rendering part of your application until it's needed (lazy-loaded) while also "suspends" the rendering of its children components until your data is ready to be rendered. 

Let's break down the parameters and the function body:

1. Parameters:

- `factory`: This is a function that should return a promise which resolves to the component you're looking to lazy-load. 

- `options` (Optional): This allows for customization of the loader, specific to its size denoted by `loaderSize`. If no options are provided, a default size is used.


2. Function Body:

- `const Component = lazy<any>(factory);` - The component to be loaded lazily is obtained from the factory function you pass.

- Then a functional component is returned. This component uses the React's `Suspense` component to wrap the lazy-loaded component. This includes a `fallback` prop that displays a `LoaderView` while the component is being loaded. Eventually, when the `factory` promise resolves, the `Component` will be rendered with the appropriate `props`.

Here's how it works:
When the `Component` returned by `heavy` is rendered, it's not immediately loaded. Instead, React displays a `fallback` loader. When React needs to render the `Component`, it runs the `factory` function to load the component code, and when the Promise is resolved, then React updates the UI with the now-loaded `Component`.

The syntax `<T extends React.ComponentType<P>, P extends object = any>` is a TypeScript way of saying that `T` must be some type of React component that accepts props of type `P`, while `P` extends object and defaults to `any`. This ensures type safety and the IntelliSense, among many other benefits offered by TypeScript. 

Overall, the `heavy` function is a generic utility for wrapping components to add lazy loading with a loading indicator.

# isEmpty

The function `isEmpty(obj: Record<string | symbol, any>)` in your TypeScript code is a helper function that checks if a given object is empty or not. It accepts an object whose keys can be either string or symbol, and values can be of any type.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. `export function isEmpty(obj: Record<string | symbol, any>)`: This line is declaring and exporting a function named `isEmpty` which takes an object parameter. The object can have `string` or `symbol` keys, and the values can be any type. This kind of object typing covers all standard objects in JavaScript since all object keys are either strings or symbols.

2. `if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj).length !== 0)`: This line checks if there are symbol properties in the object. `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)` returns an array of all symbol properties found directly upon the object. If the length of this array is not zero, that means the object has symbol properties and function returns `false`, indicating that the object is not empty.

3. `if (Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).length !== 0)`: This line checks if the object has any properties at all. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties except for those which use Symbol) found directly in a given object. If the length of this array is not zero, that means the object has some properties, hence the function returns `false` indicating the object is not empty.

4. `return true`: If the object does not have any symbol properties or any other properties, returns `true` to indicate that the object is empty.

The related class `EventEmitter` has a property `_events` and a method `hasListeners`. This method uses the `isEmpty` function to determine if the `_events` property is empty or not. If it is not empty (i.e., `!isEmpty(this._events)`), it means there are listeners attached to the emitter, so it returns `true`. If it is empty, it means no listeners are attached, so it returns `false`.

I hope this clarifies the functionality of the provided code. If you have further questions, feel free to ask!

# isObject

This TypeScript function, named `isObject`, is used to check whether a provided value is an object or not.

The function takes one parameter, `obj`, of type `any`. This means that it can accept an argument of any data type.

It returns a boolean value - `true` if the given value is an object; `false` otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. First, it uses the `typeof` operator to check if the type of `obj` is `"object"`. In JavaScript and TypeScript, an object's type is shown as `"object"` by the `typeof` operator. If `obj` is indeed an object, `typeof obj` will return `"object"`. 

2. The next condition checks if `obj` is not `null` because in JavaScript, `null` is considered an object, which can be misleading in this context.

3. If both checks pass, the function then checks that the prototype of `obj` is `Object.prototype`. This ensures the `obj` is indeed an object and not a function or an array, since functions and arrays are also considered objects in JavaScript but their prototypes are different (`Function.prototype` and `Array.prototype` respectively).

4. If the `obj` is an object and not `null`, and its prototype is `Object.prototype`, the function returns `true`; else, it returns `false`.

The function is exported, meaning it can be imported and used in other modules or files in the project. 

# isUndefined

`isUndefined`, is meant to determine if the object passed to it as an argument, `obj`, is undefined or not.

Let's go through the code:

- `export` keyword indicates that this function can be used in other modules or files in your project.
- `const isUndefined = ` declares a constant variable `isUndefined` that will hold the function. In JavaScript and TypeScript, functions are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables.
- `(obj: any) => {}` is the arrow function syntax. `obj: any` is the function parameter with type `any`, which accepts all type of values.
- `typeof obj === 'undefined'` - The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the "unevaluated" operand. Here, it's checking if `obj` is of the type 'undefined'.
- The function returns `true` if the `obj` is of type 'undefined' and `false` otherwise.

So, if you pass a variable that has not been assigned a value to this function, it would return `true`. In all other cases, it would return `false`. This is a very common way to check if a variable has a value or not in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

# list2grid

a function `list2grid` that transforms a list of columns and a payload into a specific grid configuration.

Let's break it down step by step:

The function `list2grid` takes the following arguments:
1. `columns`: An array of IColumn objects.
2. `payload`: Data used for formatting which is an object with string keys and values of any type.

The function returns an array of `IGridColumn` objects.

- The function first maps over each `IColumn` in the `columns` array.
- For each `column`, it generates a `mockName` by appending the index to the `field` property of the `column`, or if `field` doesn't exist it uses "unknown" as the prefix.
- It then checks the `type` of the `column`. If the type is `Action`, it returns `null`.
- If `type` is `CheckBox`, the function returns an `IGridColumn` object with a label (either the column's `headerName` or the `mockName`), width, field, and a format function that returns a `Checkbox` JSX element.
- If `type` is not `Action` or `CheckBox`, another `IGridColumn` object is returned with similar properties to the `CheckBox` case, but the format function can present `Async` components, call a `compute` function, or just return a simple field value.
- After the mapping, the function filters out columns that were mapped to `null` (those with type `Action`).

This is a common practice when transforming data structures. The choice for this transform function to return nulls and then filter them, rather than not returning anything (skipping them) in the first place, was likely made for code readability and debugability considerations.

The `list2grid` function is the core of displaying data in the user interface. It normalizes and transforms raw data into a format that the interface components can easily work with.

# loadScript

a function named `loadScript` which is used for loading external scripts dynamically into your webpage.

Let's discuss it in detail:

First, you have a function `loadScript` that takes two parameters:

1. `src` which should be a string representing the URL of the external script file you want to load.
2. `async` which is an optional boolean parameter indicating whether the script should be loaded asynchronously or not. By default, this parameter is set to `false` meaning the script won't be loaded asynchronously unless specified.

The function returns a `Promise<void>` . A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It's used for handling asynchronous computations, and it gives us a way to handle the computation's final value or the reason why the computation cannot be performed.

Inside the function, a new script element is created using `document.createElement('script')`. The cross-origin attribute (`crossOrigin`) of the script is set to "anonymous", which allows for anonymous fetching of the script. This means that the browser does not send any credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication details) with the request.

There are two event listeners:

1. 'load' event listener: If the script loads successfully, the promise is resolved.
2. 'error' event listener: If there's an error while loading the script (for example, the script file could not be found at the provided URL), the promise is rejected.

If the `async` parameter of the function is `true`, then the `script.async` property is set to true, loading the external script asynchronously.

Then, the script element is appended to the body of the document using `document.body.appendChild(script)`.

At the end, `script.src = src` sets the source URL of the script to the URL provided as a parameter to the function.

In summary, this function lets you load an external script dynamically from a specified URL (`src`) and provides a Promise based interface to handle the completion or failure of the loading process.

# mainColor

a function named `mainColor` that sets the main color theme of a web application. 

### Parameters: 
`mainColor` function takes a single parameter `color` which is a string type parameter. It corresponds to any valid CSS color string.

### Code Explanation:
`document.head.innerHTML += ...` is using the property `innerHTML` of the `head` tag on the `document` global object to append HTML to the head of the webpage.

The appended HTML consists of a meta tag and a style tag:

1. `<meta name="theme-color" content="${color}">`: This line adds a `meta` HTML tag to the document's `head` section with the name attribute set to `theme-color`. The `content` attribute is set to whatever string is passed to the function as an argument (`color`). This `meta` tag is generally used to set the theme color for a web application on mobile platforms.

2. `<style>...</style>`: The `style` tag encases a CSS rule which is being defined for our document. The CSS style rule applies to the `html` element and sets its `background` property to the `color` value passed as an argument to the function. The `!important` flag is included to ensure that this styling rule has high importance and cannot be overridden by later CSS rules.

### Export:
The use of the `export` keyword in front of the function declaration indicates that this function is accessible from outside its module, i.e., it can be imported in another file with an `import` statement.

Here is an example of its usage:

```typescript
mainColor('#FF5733'); // Set's the main theme color to '#FF5733'
```

Please remember that altering the `document.head.innerHTML` directly can lead to possible injection attacks (like XSS) if the `color` variable is in any way determined by user input. It's generally safer to use more specific properties (like `document.createElement`) to reduce the attack surface.

# normalizeText


The `normalizeText` function accepts two arguments: `text` (a string) and `config` (an object which represents the configuration for input formatting). The `config` object should contain the options required for input formatting. These options are `inputFormatterSymbol`, `inputFormatterAllowed`, `inputFormatterReplace`, `inputFormatterTemplate`, and `inputFormatter`. By using the `Partial<IConfig>` type, it makes all properties optional.

The `inputFormatter` function is applied to each character of the input text string, which normalizes the text. If no `inputFormatter` function is provided, a default `formatText` function will be used. The `formatText` function uses the provided `template`, `symbol`, `allowed`, and `replace` options.

The `normalizeText` function starts by checking whether the `text` is a string. If not, it initializes the result as an empty string. Then, for each character in the text, it applies the `inputFormatter` function and appends that to the result. Once all the characters have gone through the `inputFormatter` function, the function returns the `result`.

To understand this function's full functionality, one would need to see the implementation details of both `formatText` and `IConfig`.

Here's a basic overview of the interfaces and imports used:

- `IField` appears to be a type interface imported, and `IConfig` is another interface that relies on properties of type `IField`. The actual interface details would reside in the imported modules.
- The `formatText` function is imported and used as a default `inputFormatter` if no `inputFormatter` is passed in the `config` object.

Remember: This code depends heavily on the `formatText` function and the `IConfig` interface structure, so for a deeper understanding, you would have to look at the specifications and behaviour of those as well.

# objects

function, named `objects`, is intended to recursively process an object and its nested properties. The function accepts one parameter, `root`, which is the object to process.

Let's break down its internals:

- It initializes `result` with the `root` object. The `result` variable is ultimately the returned value of the function.

- It defines an inner function, `process`, which takes in an `entry` (a nested value within the object) and a `change` callback function. The `change` callback is intended to update `result` or the current `entry` in place.

- Inside the `process` function, it checks if the `entry` is an object and not `null`.

  - If the `entry` is an array, it iterates over the elements using `forEach`. For each element, it recursively calls `process` and applies the `change` callback to the element at the corresponding index (`idx`), creating a copy of the entry array.

  - If the `entry` is an object (but not an array), it iterates over the entries of the object using `Object.entries` and `forEach`. For each pair, the `process` function is called recursively for the value `v`, and the `change` callback is updated to the array's element at the key `k`.

- After defining the `process` function, it is immediately invoked with `root` as a parameter.

- Finally, the function returns `result`, which has been updated throughout the recursive processing of the `root` object.

This function is used for deeply iterating over an object's properties and transforming them in a certain way, which is determined by the `change` callback. This function is a flexible and powerful way to handle operations that need to inspect every value in an object, regardless of how nested it is. In its current form, this function seems to transform arrays into objects with the same keys and values, but the actual transformation depends on the `change` callback passed in each recursive call. 

Please note that this function uses any TypeScript type in several places, which suggests that it can be used with objects of different shapes but also means that there's no type safety on those points. If possible, consider defining interfaces that adequately describe the `root` object's shape to maximize the benefits of TypeScript's type system.

Please, let me know if you need a more detailed explanation or have any more questions.

# openBlank

The function `openBlank` is a TypeScript function that is defined to open a given URL in a new browser tab.

The function takes one argument:

- `url`: This is a string that will be the URL of the page that you want to open in a new tab.

This function uses the built-in `document.createElement()` method to create an anchor (`<a>`) element. The `href` attribute of this anchor element is set to the URL that you want to open. The `target` attribute is set to '_blank', which ensures that the URL will open in a new tab or window.

A 'none' value for the `style.display` property means that the anchor element will not be displayed on the page (i.e., it is hidden from rendering).

The function then appends the anchor element to the body of the document with `document.body.appendChild(a)`, programmatically clicks the anchor element with `a.click()`, and finally removes the anchor element from the document body with `document.body.removeChild(a)`. 

The script `import openBlank from '../../utils/openBlank';` is used to import the function into a different module where it is to be used.

The function `openBlank` appears to be part of a utility library for a coding project that also involves React and numerous other libraries for front-end development. It is likely used at various points in the project where it's necessary to open a URL in a new tab.

# parseRouteUrl

The function `parseRouteUrl` is used for parsing and matching a provided URL against a route template. It takes two arguments: `template` and `url`. The `template` is a route pattern against which the `url` is matched. 

The function is exported, meaning it is available for use in other modules or files where it is imported.

The body of the function uses the `match` function from the `path-to-regexp` package to compare the provided `url` against the `template`. The `match` function is invoked with `template` and a configuration object as its arguments.

The configuration object specifies that the `decode` will be carried out with the `decodeURIComponent` function. This function decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component that was previously created by `encodeURIComponent` or by a similar routine in any JavaScript related context.

The result of the `match` function, when invoked with the `url`, is the result of this function. If no match is found, the `match` function will return `null`. 

The aforementioned function is being used in the given examples, where it is being called with specific route templates such as "/file", "/pdf", "/image", "/video", "/audio", "/error" and then the result is converted to a Boolean using the not (`!!`) operator.

Each of these calls is essentially a function that takes a URL and returns a Boolean indicating if the URL matches the specific route template.

Here is the TypeScript code with comments to add some more context:

```typescript
// Import the `match` function from the `path-to-regexp` package.
import { match } from "path-to-regexp";

/**
 * Parses the given route template and URL to match them and returns the result.
 *
 * @param template - The route template to match against.
 * @param url - The URL to be matched.
 * @returns - The matched result or null if no match is found.
 */
export const parseRouteUrl = (template: string, url: string) => {
    // Match the URL to the provided route `template`, decode URI components in 
    // the process, and return the result. If the match fails, return null.
    return match(template, { decode: decodeURIComponent })(url) || null;
};
```

As for the usage of the `parseRouteUrl` function, here is one example with comments:

```typescript jsx
// The `parseRouteUrl` function is imported from an external module.
import parseRouteUrl from "../../utils/parseRouteUrl";

// This function takes a URL and uses the `parseRouteUrl` function to match 
// it against the "/file" route template. The result is cast to a Boolean.
(url) => !!parseRouteUrl("/file", url)
```

# preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures

This TypeScript function helps prevent the default browser actions that could be initiated by swipe gestures at the edge of the screen.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```typescript
export const preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures = () => {
```
This line defines and exports a function called `preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures`.

```typescript
const touchStart = (event: TouchEvent) => {
```
A constant called `touchStart` is declared inside this function, which is actually another function that takes a `TouchEvent` as a parameter.

```typescript
if (event.touches.length === 1) {
  const touch = event.touches[0];
```
These lines check if the event contains only a single touch point; if so, it assigns the first (and only) touch point to the constant `touch`.

```typescript
if (
  touch.clientX < window.innerWidth * 0.1 ||
  touch.clientX > window.innerWidth * 0.9
) {
  event.preventDefault();
}
```
These lines check whether the X coordinate of the `touch` event is within the left or right 10% of the screen. If it is, it calls `event.preventDefault()`. By preventing the default behavior of the touch event on the edge of the screen, it helps prevent triggering browser history swipe gestures.

```typescript
window.addEventListener("touchstart", touchStart, { passive: false });
```
This line adds a `touchstart` event listener to the window. When a touch event occurs, it calls the `touchStart` function with the event data, possibly preventing the default action.

```typescript
return () => window.removeEventListener("touchstart", touchStart);
```
Finally, the `preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures` function returns another function. This returned function will, when called, remove the `touchStart` event listener from the window. This effectively allows disabling the behavior of preventing edge swipe gestures at any future point.

# randomString

a function named `randomString`. This function generates and returns a random string when called.

```typescript
/**
 * Generates a random string using the UUID library.
 *
 * @returns A randomly generated string.
 */
export const randomString = () => uuid();
```

This function utilizes the `uuid()` function from the `uuid` library. This library is generally used for the generation of random UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). The returned string from `uuid()` is a unique string that can be used for various purposes, such as generating unique user IDs, file names, etc.

The import statement related to this code snippet would look something like this:

```typescript
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';
```

This is importing the `v4` function from the `uuid` library, but renaming it to `uuid` for use in the code. This `v4` is a version of UUID which generates a random UUID.


# range

 an exported function named `range`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```typescript
export const range = (start: number, end: number, length = end - start) =>
  Array.from({ length }, (_, i) => start + i);
```

This function generates an array of numbers within a specified range.  The function `range` takes three arguments:

- `start` (of type number): This is the start of the range, inclusive.

- `end` (of type number): This is the end of the range, exclusive.

- `length` (of type number, optional): This defines the length of the generated array. It defaults to the difference between `end` and `start` (i.e., `end - start`).

The function uses the `Array.from` method to create an array. The length of the array is determined by the `length` parameter, and the elements of the array are calculated based on the index and the `start` value (`start + index`).

The following information and TypeScript code further illustrate how the `range` function can be used:

```typescript
describe ('Generate range with python compatibility', () => {
    it ('Will work as expected', () => {
        const created = range(0, 10);
        const { length } = created;
        const [ first ] = created;
        const [ last ] = created.reverse();
        expect(first).toBe(0);
        expect(last).toBe(9);
        expect(length).toBe(10);
    });
});
```

This code shows a test case for the `range` function. It verifies the function creates an array that starts from 0 to 9 (10 is exclusive) when passed the arguments 0 and 10. The array is expected to have a length of 10, the first element should be 0, and the last element should be 9. This test case uses JavaScript's destructuring feature to extract useful properties (like the first and last element, and the length of the array) from the generated array.

# reloadPage

an asynchronous function named `reloadPage` which is used to reload the current page. The code does a few more things as well. Let's look at its parts separately.

```typescript
export const reloadPage = async () => {
    isReloading = true;
    if (overrideRef) {
        overrideRef();
        return;
    }
```
In the above code, it sets a variable `isReloading` to `true`. Then checks if `overrideRef` exists, if "yes" then it calls it and exits the function, thus not executing the rest of the code. The `overrideRef` can be a sort of escape hatch, a function that, if defined, allows custom reloading behaviour.

```typescript
const { href, origin, protocol } = window.location;
```
This line destructures `href`, `origin`, and `protocol` from `window.location`.

```typescript
if ('caches' in window) {
    for (const cache of await window.caches.keys()) {
        await caches.delete(cache);
    }
}
```
If the browser supports Cache API, it runs a loop through all cache keys and deletes them. Hence, performing a clean up operation to delete all the cache data currently stored.

```typescript
if (protocol !== 'file:') {
    const url = new URL(href, origin);
    url.pathname = '/';
    url.search = '';
    url.hash = '';
    window.location.href = url.toString();
}
```
If the page's protocol isn't `file:` (meaning, the page is served over HTTP, HTTPS, etc.), it creates a new URL object from the url of the current page. It then modifies the new URL to point to the root page (`/`) and clears out any search strings or hash fragments. Finally, it sets `window.location.href` to that new URL, effectively navigating the browser to that page.

```typescript
else {
    window.location.reload(true);
}
```
If the page protocol is `file:`, then it tries to reload the page by `window.location.reload(true)`. The `true` passed to the `reload()` function tells the browser to perform a hard reload, bypassing the cache.

This `reloadPage` function seems to be widely used in other parts of your code. It is generally used when there is a need to re-fetch data from the server, clear down local state, or to reflect newly updated information on the web page.

For example, in your provided code snippets, `reloadPage` is called in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` block inside the `setValue` functions of the classes returned by `createLsManager` and `createSsManager` functions. If an error (specifically a `DOMException`) occurs while trying to set a new item in the local storage or session storage (likely because the storage quota has been exceeded), it would clear the storage and then reload the page.

# removeExtraSpaces

`removeExtraSpaces` in the given TypeScript code is created to eliminate all the extra spaces from a given string. 

The function parameter is:
- `str`: a string input from which extra spaces are to be removed.

This function uses a `do`...`while` loop which continues until the length of the string before and after removing the spaces no longer changes - this implies that there are no more extra spaces left in the string.

Inside the loop:
- The current length of the string is first stored in the variable `prevLength`. 
- Then, the function uses `split("  ")` to divide the string into an array of substrings wherever it encounters two spaces.
- `join(" ")` method is used to combine those substrings back into a single string with only one space in place of the original two spaces.

When the loop ends, the string `str` with extra spaces removed is returned

# removeSubstring

named `removeSubstring`, is used to remove specific substrings from a given input text.

Let me breakdown the function operation:

* `export const removeSubstring = (text: string, ...remove: string[]) => {`
   - This defines a function named `removeSubstring` that takes an input text`text` and an array of substrings to remove `remove` as parameters. The usage of `...` (spread operator) in the parameter `...remove: string[]` indicates that `removeSubstring` function can take in multiple strings to remove from `text` during invocation of the function.

* `let result = text;`
   - This line initializes a local variable `result` that is originally the same as the provided `text`. 

* `remove.forEach((item) => (result = result.split(item).join("").trim()));`
   - For each string in `remove`, the function splits `result` into an array of strings at each occurrence of that item, rejoins these strings without the item (effectively replacing it with an empty string), and trims any leading or trailing whitespace. The result is assigned back to `result`

* `return result;`
   - Finally, the modified `result` is returned from the function.

Therefore, when you invoke this function with a string and one or several substrings to remove, it replaces every occurrence of each substring in the text with an empty string, effectively removing them from the original string.

Here is an example usage:

```typescript
console.log(removeSubstring("This is a sample text", "is", "a"));  // Output would be: "Th  smple text"
```
In this example, the substrings "is" and "a" are removed from the initial string "This is a sample text", leading to "Th  smple text". Note that spaces are left where words were removed, and these are not eliminated.

# replaceSubstring

a function `replaceSubstring` that takes three parameters - `str`, `from`, and `to` - and replaces occurrences of a substring(s) `from` in the string `str` with a new substring(s) `to`. 

Here is a detailed explanation:

1. `str: string` is the original string where replacements are to be made.

2. `from: string[] | string` is the substring or an array of substrings that will be replaced. The function accepts either a single string or an array of strings.

3. `to: string[] | string` is the new substring or an array of substrings that replaces the old substring(s) `from`.

The function body does the replacement as follows:

- It initializes a new string `result` to be the given string `str`.
  
- The variables `fromChunks` and `toChunks` are arrays that are created by turning `from` and `to` respectively into arrays of strings. This is done using a helper function called `flatArray()` that presumably turns its inputs into flattened arrays.
  
- Then an `if` statement checks if the lengths of `fromChunks` and `toChunks` are equal or not. 
  
  - If the lengths are not equal, it means that there are more `from` substrings than `to` substrings. In this case, it replaces each `from` substring with the first `to` substring (or an empty string if there are no `to` substrings). This replacement is done with the `split()` and the `join()` methods. `split()` separates the string into an array of substrings at each instance of the target substring, and `join()` merges them together again with the new substring inserted.
  
  - If the lengths are equal, it means that each `from` substring has a corresponding `to` substring. In this case, it replaces each `from` substring with its corresponding `to` substring.

Finally, the function returns the modified string.

The helper function `flatArray()` comes from an external module as you can see from the import statement `import flatArray from "./flatArray"`. We don't have access to the actual implementation of this function, but from the context, it likely takes an array (possibly with nested arrays) and returns a "flattened" version where all elements are on the top level.

# roundTicks


This function takes two parameters: `price` and an optional `tickSize` which defaults to 8 if no value is provided.

```typescript
export const roundTicks = (price: number, tickSize = 8) => {
...
};
```

The `price` parameter is a number that you want to format as a string with a fixed number of decimal places.

The `tickSize` parameter is an optional parameter that defines the number of decimal places.

Inside the body of the function, `roundTicks` constructs a new instance of `Intl.NumberFormat`. This JavaScript object enables language-sensitive number formatting. The code is using the 'en-US' locale, which represents English as used in the United States. It tells `Intl.NumberFormat` to return a string that is a representation of the `price` rounded to have exactly `tickSize` decimal places.

```typescript
const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'decimal',
    minimumFractionDigits: tickSize,
    maximumFractionDigits: tickSize
});
```

The `style` option is set to 'decimal' which means that plain number formatting is used.

The `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` options are set to `tickSize` which ensures that the number `price` will be formatted with a fixed number of `tickSize` decimal places.

Finally, the method `format(price)` is called on the `formatter` instance, which produces a string representation of `price` in the specified format: 

```typescript
return formatter.format(price);
```

So, the function `roundTicks` is used to take a numerical price and format it as a string with a specific number of decimal places.

# set


This TypeScript function named `set` is used to update a value at a specific path within a deeply nested object. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function:

**Parameters**: 
1. `object` (type: `any`): This is the object that is to be updated.
2. `path` (type: `any`): This is the path to the property within the object. The path can either be a string separated by dots or an array of strings. Each string in the path represents a level in the object.
3. `value` (type: `any`): This is the new value that you want to set for the property at the given path.

**Steps**:
1. The function starts by splitting the `path` into constituents. If `path` is an array, it leaves them as is; if it's a string, it splits it on the '.' delimiter.
2. Using Array `flatMap` method, the function makes sure that all parts are in the format of flatten array of strings. If a part of the path is already is a string, it splits it again ensuring we have a consistent path format.
3. It then separates the last part of the path (the property to be updated), and keeps a reference to it in `name`.
4. The `parentPath` is then a slice of the array excluding the last item.
5. A `reduce` method is used on `parentPath` to traverse to the deeply nested object where the property resides. If in any occurrence, the `obj[key]` is `undefined`, `reduce` will continue with `undefined`, making `parent` be `undefined`.
6. In a try-catch block, the function attempts to assign the new `value` to the desired property of the nested object (`parent[name] = value`). If the operation is successful, it means the property exists and has been updated, and the function returns `true`. If the operation fails and throws an error (for example, if `parent` is `undefined` because the path does not exist), then the function catches the error and returns `false`.

Here's a usage example:

```typescript
let obj = { a: { b: { c: 'old_value' } } };
set(obj, 'a.b.c', 'new_value');
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // outputs: 'new_value'
```

This code updates the value of `'c'` to `'new_value'` in the object `obj`.

# sha256

an asynchronous function called `sha256` which computes the SHA-256 hash of a given message. This might be useful in many cases, including data integrity check or password storage.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- Function declaration: `export const sha256 = async (message: string) => {...};` this is an exportable asynchronous function named `sha256`, taking a single parameter `message` of type string (the value to hash).

- `const msgBuffer = new TextEncoder().encode(message);` the `TextEncoder` interface represents an encoder for a specific method, that is a specific encoding, like utf-8, iso-8859-2, koi8, cp1261, gbk, etc. A `TextEncoder` object has an `encode()` method that converts a JavaScript string into a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. Here it's used to convert the input string into a `Uint8Array` of bytes.

- `const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', msgBuffer);` this line actually computes the SHA-256 hash of this byte array using the built-in Web API's `crypto.subtle.digest` method. This method returns a Promise that resolves to the hash as an `ArrayBuffer`, so it's `await`ed to get the result.

- `const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));` this converts the `ArrayBuffer` into a regular array of bytes (`Uint8Array`), so it can be easily manipulated.

- `return hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');` this converts each byte in the array into a hexadecimal string (with `b.toString(16)`), pads it on the left with zeroes to ensure it's two characters long (`padStart(2, '0')`), and then concatenates all these strings together (with `.join('')`) to form the final hash.

So the `sha256` method turns an input string into its SHA-256 hash value, represented as a string of hexadecimal characters. This operation is asynchronous, so it returns a `Promise` that will eventually resolve to the hash string.

# sleep


This function takes a parameter, `timeout`, which is the amount of time in milliseconds to pause execution for. The default `timeout` value is 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second), in the case that no specific value is provided when the function is called.

The `sleep` function then passes this `timeout` value to `setTimeout()`, which is a built-in JavaScript function that performs a provided function after a specified delay. In this case, it resolves a Promise after the `timeout` period has elapsed. 

```typescript
export const sleep = (timeout = 1000) => new Promise<void>((res) => setTimeout(() => res(), timeout));
```
In short, this `sleep` function is a utility function used to pause the execution of asynchronous operations in a more convenient and readable form than using `setTimeout` directly.

Later sections feature some TypeScript and TSX (TypeScript combined with JSX) code that define some interfaces (like `IParams`, `IResult`, `IAsyncProps` etc.), TypeScript types, and React hooks. This includes import statements for specific methods from different imported files and modules. For example, `useState` function from the 'react' module, `makeStyles` method for creating CSS-in-JavaScript styles, etc. 

Please note that to give a concise and comprehensive explanation I would need context as to how these interfaces and methods are used in your program, as this code seems to be pulled from different sections of your application and piecing them together without additional context can be challenging. 

For a personalized explanation of all the code snippets, please provide more context or ask about specific sections of the code.

# templateStr

The `templateStr` function is an exported TypeScript function. This function takes a template string and one or more context objects and replaces placeholders within the string with corresponding values from the context object(s).

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

- The function `templateStr` has two parameters: `str` and `...contexts`. `str` is a string, and `...contexts` is a rest parameter which groups any number of arguments into an array, and each argument is expected to be an object (`Record<string, unknown>[]`).

- The `context` constant is an object that contains all properties from each context object. This is achieved by calling the `reduce` method on the `contexts` array. The `reduce` method is used to apply a function (in this case an object spread operation that merges the current object with the accumulated one) against an accumulator and each context object in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single object.

- The `return` statement utilizes the `replace` function. The `replace` function is a method of `string` that returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern, provided as a regular expression, matches substrings enclosed by curly braces `{}` that consist of alphanumeric characters, underscores `_`, or hyphens `-`.

- The callback function provided to the `replace` method takes the matched string `match`, removes the enclosing curly braces using `match.replace(/{|}/g, "")` and then checks if a property with the resulting `key` exists in the `context` object.

- If such a property exists and is not `undefined`, the value of this `key` in the context object (converted to a string) is used as the replacement. If the `key` is not present in the `context` object or its value is `undefined`, an empty string `""` is returned, meaning the placeholder will be replaced with nothing.

Here is how you might use this function:

```typescript
const str = 'Hello {name}, today is {day}';
const context = { name: 'John', day: 'Monday' };
console.log(templateStr(str, context)); // outputs: Hello John, today is Monday
```
In this example, `{name}` is replaced with `John` and `{day}` is replaced with `Monday`.

# toRouteUrl

`toRouteUrl`, generates a URL using a template string and a parameters object. It's a function in a module that is designed to be imported and used elsewhere in your application.

Here's what each part does:

- **`export` keyword:** It allows the function to be accessible from other modules in your application.

- **`toRouteUrl` function:** This is a function named `toRouteUrl`. It's an arrow function which takes two parameters:
  - `template`: This should be a string that represents the route URL.
  - `params`: An object containing the parameters that should be filled into the URL template.

- **`const toPath = compile(template, { encode: decodeURIComponent });` line:** Here, it's calling a function `compile` from the "path-to-regexp" library, passing in the `template` string and an options object with `encode` set to `decodeURIComponent`. The `compile` function converts a string into a regexp and returns a function for generating string paths from an object.

- **`return toPath(params);` line:** It calls the function `toPath` that was returned by `compile`, passing `params` as an argument. This generates the final URL string based on the template and parameters.

So, if the `template` string contains tokens like `"/user/:id"`, and `params` object is `{ id: "123" }`, the function will return `"/user/123"`.

Please note that the `path-to-regexp` package allows you to turn strings into regular expressions (useful for path matching) and also to generate strings (useful for URL creation) when provided with a set of parameters.

# waitForBlur

`waitForBlur`, is an asynchronous utility function that waits for an HTML element referred to by `ref` to lose focus or to be removed from the document body.

The function parameters are as follows:

- `ref` is the reference of the HTML element that we want to wait for it to lose focus or get removed.
- `debounce` is an optional parameter representing the time interval in milliseconds for checking the blur condition. The default value is 50 milliseconds.

The function returns a Promise that gets resolved when either of the following conditions are met:

- The active element in the document is not the referred HTML element and is not contained within the referred element.
- The referred element is not contained within the document body.

A `setInterval` loop is used to periodically check every `debounce` milliseconds if these conditions are met. If they are, the interval is cleared and the Promise gets resolved.

This function could be used when you want to perform an operation after an element loses focus or is removed, you might call this function with a `.then()` or an `await` to do your operation.

Here is how the function can be used:

```typescript
// Assuming 'elem' is a HTML element.
waitForBlur(elem).then(() => {
  console.log("Element has lost focus or removed from the body");
});
```

In this code, the message "Element has lost focus or removed from the body" would be logged once the `elem` either loses focus or is removed from the document body.

Don't forget to handle a possible promise failure if needed.

# waitForSize

 a utility function named `waitForSize`, which is designed to hold the execution until the provided HTML element (`ref`) has non-zero size. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

```typescript
/**
 * Waits for the size of the provided element to be non-zero.
 *
 * @param ref - The element to wait for the size to be non-zero.
 * @returns - A promise that resolves when the size is non-zero.
 */
export const waitForSize = (ref: HTMLElement) => new Promise<void>((res) => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const { height, width } = ref.getBoundingClientRect();
        if (height || width) {
            clearInterval(interval);
            res();
        }
    }, 50);
});
```

- `ref: HTMLElement`: This is the HTML element for which to wait until the size (either width or height) is non-zero.

- `new Promise<void>((res) => {...})`: The function returns a Promise that resolves when the size of the element is non-zero. The Promise doesn't return any value upon resolution (`void`). `res` is the resolution function provided by the Promise constructor.

- `const interval = setInterval(() => {...}, 50);`: An interval is set up to run every 50 milliseconds. This interval keeps checking if the size (either height or width) of the `ref` element is non-zero.

- `const { height, width } = ref.getBoundingClientRect();`: Using destructuring, the height and width properties are retrieved from the `ref` element's `ClientRect` object, which is returned by `getBoundingClientRect()`. This object contains information about the size and position of the `ref` element.

- `if (height || width) {...}`: When either the height or the width becomes non-zero, the execution proceeds.

- `clearInterval(interval);`: The interval is cleared, stopping the periodic checks.

- `res();`: The Promise is resolved.

This function would be useful in scenarios where you need to perform some action with an HTML element once it has a non-zero size, which happens when the element gets rendered and visible in the DOM.

The other pieces of provided TypeScript and TypeScript React (TSX) code seem to be interfacing and utility functions related to a container component and/or a Hero component, breakpoints for responsive design, and some TypeScript-specific types. There's no direct connection with the `waitForSize` function in these codes, unless `waitForSize` is imported and used somewhere within your components or utilities.

# waitForMove

The TypeScript function `waitForMove` is an exported function that accepts a function `fn` as its single argument. This function `fn` should be of a type that takes no arguments and does not return a value (signified by `() => void`).

The function `waitForMove` connects the `fn` function to the `moveSource`, essentially meaning that the `fn` function will be executed whenever a move event occurs.

The code provided suggests that `moveSource` is an amalgamation of several different sources (`mouseSource`, `touchSource`, and `scrollSource`) which are merged into a single event source. The `moveSource` emits an event every `MOVE_DELTA` times (`count` is used for this purpose internally) one of the merged source emits an event.

So to put simply, `waitForMove` is somewhat acting as an event listener where `fn` is the callback function being called when the event (a `move` here) takes place after `MOVE_DELTA` counts.

Just for clarity, as the actual implementations and functionalities of `Source`, `merge`, `filter`, `tap`, and `share` are not provided, explanations related to them are based on general assumptions.

# waitForTab


The provided function `waitForTab` is an exported function that accepts a callback function (`fn: () => void`) as an argument. This callback function does not take in any arguments and does not return anything.

The purpose of `waitForTab` is to use the `tabSource` to connect the provided callback function (`fn`). This happens inside `tabSource.connect(fn);`.

The `tabSource` variable, as described, is a unicast source of "keydown" events for the "Tab" key. It is created by using a set of chained methods and functions. 

Let's break it down:

- `Source.unicast(() => ...)`  
This part is creating a new unicast source. The `unicast` function is creating a new source that can have a single consumer.

- `Source.create<void>((handler) => { ... })`  
This function creates a new source where the content of the source is defined by an inner function that accepts a handler. This handler in turn is connected to a 'keydown' event.

- `Source.fromEvent('keydown').connect((e: any) => { ... })`  
This part is creating a new source from a "keydown" event and connects a function to be fired when the event occurs. If the event's code is "Tab", it will call the `handler` function.

- `.share()`  
The `share` function makes the `tabSource` be shared among multiple subscribers. This means that the "Tab" keypress events will be dispatched to all connected event handlers (subscribers).

So, in essence, the `waitForTab` function essentially connects the passed-in callback function (`fn`) to a unicast source of "Tab" keydown events. That is, when the "Tab" keydown event happens, the connected function (`fn`) will execute.

# waitForTouch

The given TypeScript code defines an exported function called `waitForTouch` that takes another function `fn` as an argument. The function `fn` should have no parameters and not return anything. The `waitForTouch` function is designed to wait for a "touch" event before calling the `fn` function.

The way it works is by connecting to an event source, specifically `touchSource`, and hooks up the `fn` function to execute whenever the event source emits. 

Here, `touchSource` is an observable, which is an event source that emits touch or click events. When `touchSource.connect(fn)` is called, `fn` will be called every time a `touchstart` or `mousedown` event occurs. That's because, in the implementation of `touchSource`, both `touchstart` and `mousedown` events are hooked up to the event source.

So, to sum it up, `waitForTouch` function is used to execute some specific functionality (defined by `fn` function) whenever the user touches the screen or clicks the mouse button.

Here is the code explained in detail:

```typescript
/**
 * Waits for a touch event and calls the provided function.
 *
 * @param fn - The function to be called when a touch event occurs.
 */
export const waitForTouch = (fn: () => void) => {
    return touchSource.connect(fn); // Connect the passed function `fn` to the `touchSource` event source.
};
```

# wordForm

The provided `wordForm` function takes a numeric value and an object called `options`. This `options` object has three properties: `one`, `many`, and an optional `two` which defaults to `many` if not provided. All these properties are expected to be strings. These strings are different forms of a word to use depending on the numeric value.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. If the numeric value is exactly 0, or between 11 and 19 (inclusive), the function uses the `many` form.
2. If the last digit of the numeric value is 0, the function uses the `many` form.
3. If the last digit of the numeric value is 1, the function uses the `one` form.
4. If the last digit of the numeric value is between 2 to 4 (inclusive), the function uses the `two` form (or `many` if `two` isn't provided).
5. In any other case, the function uses the `many` form.

The function then returns a string composed of the number and the appropriate word form. 

```typescript
export const wordForm = (value: number, {
  one,
  many,
  two = many,
}: IWordForm) => {
  const getWord = () => {
    if (value === 0 || (value >= 11 && value < 20)) return many
    let lastDigit = value % 10
    if (lastDigit === 0) return many
    if (lastDigit === 1) return one
    if (lastDigit < 5) return two
    return many
  };
  return `${value} ${getWord()}`;
};
```

For example, if we're dealing with selecting multiple items and we want to provide proper labeling, we could use the `selectionLabelDefault` function. The `selectionLabelDefault` function creates a string that indicates how many items have been selected. It uses the `wordForm` to get the correct word form depending on the quantity.

```typescript
const selectionLabelDefault = (size: number) => {
    return `Selected: ${wordForm(size, {
        one: 'item',
        many: 'items',
    })}`;
};
```
