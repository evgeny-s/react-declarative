# arrays

The "arrays" function is a utility in TypeScript that converts nested object properties into arrays. It takes two parameters: "root", which is the root object to be converted, and "forceArray", an optional parameter that determines whether all objects should be converted into arrays, regardless of the presence of numeric keys. The function operates recursively, checking for numeric keys in each object and converting them into arrays using `Object.values()`. The provided code also includes a `hasNumberKey` function to check if an object has any numeric keys and a testing setup using Jest to verify the function's correctness. This utility can be useful when working with JavaScript objects and wanting to interact with them as arrays, allowing the use of array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

# asciiParams

The `parseAsciiParams` utility function takes an array of ASCII codes and converts them into an object. It uses generics to allow for flexible return types, with the default being an object where keys are strings and values can be of any type. The function first converts each ASCII code into its corresponding character, then splits the resulting string into key-value pairs. It further processes specific values, such as converting "true", "false", and "null" strings into their respective boolean or null values, and parsing valid numbers into float values. Finally, it creates an object from the key-value pairs using `Object.fromEntries()`. If any errors occur during this process, the function returns null.

# parseBase64Json

The `parseBase64Json` is a utility function that takes a Base64-encoded string as input and returns a JavaScript object after decoding and parsing it into JSON format. It is a generic function that uses TypeScript's type inference to determine the object structure based on how it is used. The function first decodes the Base64-encoded string using the `decode` method from a provided `base64` object. Then, it parses the decoded string into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse`. If any error occurs during decoding or parsing, the function catches it and returns null. The `base64` object has a `decode` method that converts Base64 strings back to their original form by converting each character (representing 6 bits of data) into its corresponding byte value. The `encode` method is the opposite of `decode`, but it's not directly relevant to the functionality of `parseBase64Json`.

# stringifyBase64Json

The `stringifyBase64Json` function is a utility that transforms an object into a Base64-encoded JSON string. It works by first converting the input state object into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify(state)`, and then encoding this JSON string into Base64 using the `base64.encode` function from the `base64` object. The function is generic, meaning it can work with arguments of any type. If no specific type is provided when calling the function, TypeScript assumes that `T` is a `Record<string, any>`. The `base64.encode` function converts a string into Base64 by taking each character of the input, converting it to its char code, and using the char code to generate the Base64 string. In summary, `stringifyBase64Json` is a utility function that takes an object as input and outputs a Base64-encoded JSON string, utilizing the `encode` function from the `base64` object to perform the Base64 encoding.

# cacheSrc

cacheSrc is a utility function in TypeScript that allows you to cache image URLs and apply them to an HTMLImageElement. It uses JavaScript's closure feature to remember the provided `url` parameter for later use. This function takes an image URL as a parameter and returns another function that can be used to set the source of an HTMLImageElement with the cached image.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
```typescript
function cacheSrc(url: string): ((element: HTMLImageElement | null) => void) {
    const cacheManager = { /* ... */ };
    const cacheMap = new Map(); // Cache for storing URLs and their corresponding Blob objects
    
    return (ref: (element: HTMLImageElement | null) => {
        if (element) { // If the image element is still in the DOM
            element.style.visibility = 'hidden'; // Hide the image
            
            cacheManager.createPromise(url).then((blob) => { // Create a Promise to cache the image
                if (document.contains(element)) { // If the image element is still in the DOM
                    element.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob); // Set the image source to the cached image
                    element.style.visibility = 'visible'; // Reveal the image with the new source
                }
            });
        }
    });
}
```
The function `cacheSrc(url)` utilizes other methods like `createPromise`, `_cacheMap`, and `toBlob` to achieve its functionality.
- `cacheManager.createPromise(url)`: This method creates a Promise that returns a Blob object. If a Blob for the URL doesn't already exist in the cache (checked via `_cacheMap`), it will create a new Blob via `toBlob(url)` and store that in the cache.
- `_cacheMap`: This is a Map used as a cache. The keys in this Map are URLs of images, and the values are Promises that resolve to Blob objects representing the images.
- `toBlob`: This method converts an image URL `src` to a `Promise<Blob>`. It uses a Canvas to load the image and convert it into a `Blob` enriched with the image data.
By caching images, this utility function aims to improve performance by avoiding redundant network requests for images. It can be particularly beneficial when the same image is rendered multiple times or across different components. While the image from the `url` is being loaded and turned into a Blob, the related HTMLImageElement will be hidden. Once the Blob is ready and loaded as a source for the HTMLImageElement, it will be set to visible.

# chooseFile

The `chooseFile` function is a utility that allows you to open a file chooser dialog in your TypeScript application using the browser's underlying input element of type 'file'. It returns a Promise that resolves with the selected file (as a `File` type) or null if the selection is cancelled by the user.

The function takes an optional parameter `accept`, which is a string that can be used to filter the file types or extensions that can be selected from the dialog. It creates a new input element of type 'file' and appends it to the document body. If an `accept` parameter is provided, it assigns the value to the `accept` attribute of the input element.

When a file is selected, an `onchange` event is triggered. This event removes the input element from the document body, retrieves the selected file(s) from `input.files`, and resolves the Promise with the first file. If no files are selected or if the selection is cancelled, the Promise does nothing and returns.

The function also includes a `waitForResume` function, which waits for some user action. After a delay, if the selection was cancelled, it removes the input element and resolves the Promise with null.

Finally, calling `input.click()` triggers the file dialog to open.

# chooseMultipleFiles

The `chooseMultipleFiles` function is a utility that allows users to select multiple files using a file chooser dialog. It takes an optional `accept` parameter to filter the file types that can be selected. The function returns a promise which resolves to an array of `File` objects or null.

To achieve this, the function creates an invisible `input` element with a type of 'file' and multiple attribute set to "1". If an `accept` parameter is provided, it sets the accept attribute of the `input` element. The `input` element is then added to the body of the document.

An `onchange` event listener is added to the `input` element. When triggered, it removes the `input` element from the document body, sets a flag `isCanceled` to false, resolves the selected files from the promise, and clears the value of the `input` element.

The function waits for the user to interact with the document using a `waitForResume` function. After the delay defined by `CLEANUP_DELAY`, it checks the `isCanceled` flag. If it's true, the function removes the `input` element from the document body (if it exists) and resolves the promise with null.

Finally, it programmatically opens the file chooser dialog by invoking the click method on the `input` element.

This utility can be used to allow users to upload multiple files at once, such as in a file uploading application. It provides the convenience of selecting multiple files using a file chooser dialog and returns the selected files to the caller of `chooseMultipleFiles` through a promise.

# classNames

The `classNames` function is a utility tool used in front-end web development with JavaScript and TypeScript. Its purpose is to dynamically generate class names for HTML elements. It takes a variable number of arguments and can handle arguments of any type. It initializes an empty array to hold the classes that will be used for an HTML element.

The function processes each argument as follows: if the argument is a non-null string, it assumes the string is a class name and adds it to the array. If the argument is an array, it recursively calls `classNames` on the array elements and adds the result to the classes if it's not an empty string. If the argument is an object, it checks if the object has its own `toString` method and adds the result to classes if it's not empty. If the object does not have its own `toString` method, it uses `Object.entries(arg)` to get an array of `[key, value]` pairs from the object and adds the key (assumed to be a classname) to the array if the value is truthy.

Finally, the function returns a string of class names concatenated with spaces, which can be used in a HTML class attribute. This function is extremely useful for dynamically styling components where the style may change based upon various properties or state.

# compareArray

The `compareArray` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to compare two arrays and determine if they are equal. It accepts two arguments, `a_arr` and `b_arr`, which can hold any type of values. The function first checks if both input parameters are arrays using `Array.isArray()`. If either of them is not an array, the function returns `false`.

Next, it checks if the lengths of both arrays are equal. If they have different lengths, the function returns `false`, indicating that the arrays are not equal.

To perform a deep equality check, the function clones both arrays using the spread operator (`...`) and sorts them using a custom `compareFn` function. This ensures that the comparison is based on both the values and their order in the arrays.

Finally, the function uses the `every()` method to compare each element of the sorted arrays based on their indices. If all corresponding elements in both arrays are the same, the function returns `true`, indicating that the arrays are equal. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

In summary, the `compareArray` function provides a deep equality check for arrays in TypeScript, allowing you to determine if two arrays have the same elements and order.

# compareFulltext

The `compareFulltext` function is a generic utility that allows you to compare a search term against one or more values in an object of any type. It takes the data object (`T`) and a search term as parameters, along with an array of keys to be compared from the object. The function checks if any word in the search term is included within the values of the specified keys in the data object. It returns `true` if there is a match and `false` otherwise. This utility is useful for performing full-text searches within objects of various types.

# compose

The `compose` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to combine multiple functions into a single function that executes them in reverse order. It takes an arbitrary number of functions as arguments and returns a new function. If no functions are provided, the `compose` function returns a new function that simply returns its input unchanged. If only one function is provided, it returns that function as-is. However, if multiple functions are provided, it creates a new function that executes the input functions in reverse order, with each function's output serving as the input for the next function. This process is known as function composition and can be useful when you need to apply multiple transformations or actions in a specific order. In the provided code, `compose` is used to ensure that both the `clearInterval` function and another disposer function are executed when necessary, maintaining the correct order of execution.

# copyToClipboard

The `copyToClipboard` function is an asynchronous utility that attempts to copy a given text string to the system clipboard. It takes a single parameter, `text`, which represents the text you want to copy. The function returns a Promise, allowing you to handle the result of the operation asynchronously.

Inside the function, a boolean flag called `isOk` is used to indicate the success of the operation. The function uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during the copying process.

If an `overrideRef` is provided, the function calls it with `text` as an argument. If no `overrideRef` is present, the function uses a `doCopy` function to copy the text. The `doCopy` function checks if the browser supports the `copyToClipboard` method in `navigator`. If it does, the function uses `navigator.copyToClipboard` to copy the text. If not, it falls back to using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. If an error occurs during these operations, the function attempts to use a `fallbackCopy` method as a backup.

If any errors are thrown during the copying operations, the function catches them and logs the error to the console. The `isOk` flag is set to `false`, indicating that the operation was not successful.

Regardless of whether an error occurred or not, the function returns the `isOk` variable, indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

The `fallbackCopy` function provides a fallback method for copying text to the clipboard using older browser techniques. It creates a temporary text area within the HTML document, places the text into this area, selects it (as if the user had highlighted it), and then attempts to copy this selection.

The `createCopyHandler` function creates a new function that waits for a user event (like a click), verifies that the `content` is one of the acceptable types (string, number, boolean, undefined, or null), and then attempts to `copyToClipboard`. The function uses the `await` keyword to pause until the copy operation is completed, allowing you to handle the result asynchronously.

Without more information about `overrideRef`, it's difficult to determine its exact purpose, but it could be a reference to a React component or element.

# create

The Typescript utility function "create" allows you to create a nested property within an object based on the provided path. It first checks if the given `path` is an array, and if not, it splits the string path using the '.' character and filters out any falsey keys. Then, it flattens the path array by splitting any arrays within it, which helps in handling cases where the path includes sub-properties within an array.

Finally, the function iterates through each element in the flattened path array (excluding the last element) and creates properties on the original object based on these keys. It uses the reduce function to successively dig into the object and create properties as necessary. If a property already exists, it uses that one; otherwise, it creates a new object.

This utility function is useful for manipulating objects based on string paths, which are commonly used in JavaScript for accessing deeply nested properties. It can be used in scenarios where you want to programmatically set deeply nested values in an object but don't know the path ahead of time. The function modifies the passed object in place without returning any output.

# createCustomTag

The `createCustomTag` function is a utility that allows you to create custom HTML tags with specific names, styles, and event handlers. It takes three parameters: `name` (default "bgcolor-red"), `style` (default ""), and an optional object `Partial<IConfig>` containing the event handlers `onClick` and `onInit`. The function creates a custom HTML tag element by constructing an `HTMLDivElement` and applying the provided style and event handlers. It then defines the custom element using `customElements.define` to make it usable in your HTML code. The `IConfig` interface defines the expected method signatures for `onClick` and `onInit`, allowing you to specify custom click and initialization behavior for your new HTML tag.

# createDict

The `createDict` function is a utility that takes an object of type `T`, where `T` extends the `Dict` type, and converts it into a dictionary. The resulting dictionary does not inherit properties from `Object.prototype` and is frozen, meaning its properties cannot be added, removed or changed. 

The function first creates a new empty object `dict` using `Object.create(null)`, which ensures that the new object does not inherit any properties or methods from `Object.prototype`. Then, it uses `Object.assign` to copy all enumerable own properties from the `record` object to the new `dict` object. Finally, it returns the frozen `dict` object using `Object.freeze`.

The `Dict` type is defined as an alias for objects where the keys are strings and values can be of any type. This `Dict` type is used in the `createDict` function for the `record` parameter and as a default type for the generic `T`.

# createLsManager

The `createLsManager` function is a utility that generates an anonymous class for managing interactions with the local storage. This class has three main methods: `getValue`, `setValue`, and `clear`. The `getValue` method retrieves the value associated with a given `STORAGE_KEY` from the local storage, attempting to parse it as JSON. If an error occurs during parsing, it returns `null`. The `setValue` method sets the value for a given `STORAGE_KEY`. It first stringifies the value to JSON format and then attempts to set it in the local storage. If the local storage quota is exceeded, it clears the local storage and reloads the page. The `clear` method removes the value associated with a given `STORAGE_KEY` from the local storage. The `createLsManager` function uses generic syntax to allow the calling code to specify the type for key/value pair it manages, with a default type of `Record<string, any>`. The generated manager class can be used for any local storage interactions where a specific key is used repeatedly.

The `createLsStateProvider` function is a higher-order component that wraps the `StateProvider` component and provides additional functionality. It uses the anonymous class returned by `createLsManager` to manage a single item in the state. It also takes an optional callback function `onChange` which is triggered whenever the state changes. The `StateProvider` component uses the initial state value from local storage (if available, else uses the provided `initialState`) and sets up a listener for state changes to store the updated state in local storage as well as triggering the `onChange` callback (if provided). The `useStateProvider` hook, returned alongside `WrappedStateProvider`, is expected to be used within the component wrapped by `WrappedStateProvider`. However, additional information about `createStateProvider` and `reloadPage` is needed to provide a more comprehensive explanation of their role and usage in the provided code.

# createLsStateProvider

The `createLsStateProvider` is a utility function that creates a state provider capable of persisting its state in the browser's local storage. It takes a generic parameter `S` to specify the type of state and a string parameter `storageKey` to specify the key used for storing state values in local storage.

The function uses two utility functions, `createLsManager` and `createStateProvider`, to manage local storage with the provided key and create a state provider, respectively. `createLsManager` creates a manager object for local storage, providing functions to get value from, set value into, and clear the local storage. It handles JSON serialization and deserialization when storing and retrieving state values.

`createStateProvider` is not shown, but it seems to return a React component (StateProvider) wrapped with state management and a hook function (useStateProvider) for the component's state management.

`WrappedStateProvider`, a Higher-Order Component (HOC), extends the functionality of `StateProvider`. It automatically saves state to local storage whenever it changes and initializes the state from local storage.

The function returns a tuple `[WrappedStateProvider, useStateProvider]`, which are the wrapped state provider component and the state change hook. This allows for creation of a stateful component that persists its state in local storage and a hook function for interacting with this state. Changes to the state are automatically persisted into local storage.

# createSsManager

The `createSsManager` function is a utility for managing session storage keys and values in the browser. It takes one argument, `STORAGE_KEY`, which is a string representing the key used to store a value in session storage. The function returns an instance of an anonymous class with three methods: `getValue`, `setValue`, and `clear`.

The `getValue` method retrieves a value from session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`. If found, it parses the value from a JSON string to its original format and returns it. If the value is not found or an error occurs while parsing the JSON string, it returns `null`.

The `setValue` method takes a value, converts it to a JSON string, and stores it in session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`. It also handles the `DOMException` that may occur when session storage is full. In such cases, it clears the session storage and reloads the page.

The `clear` method removes a value from session storage using the `STORAGE_KEY`.

The `<T = Record<string, any>>` part of the function signature is a default generic type. This allows TypeScript to infer the type of data stored in session storage. It defaults to a `Record` of any key-value pair if no type is provided.

The `createSsStateProvider` function uses the `createSsManager` to implement state persistence by storing the state values in session storage. It wraps the original StateProvider component to automatically store state changes in session storage and initializes the state value from session storage.

# createSsStateProvider

The `createSsStateProvider` function in TypeScript is a utility that creates a state provider for React components with persistent storage using session storage. It takes in a `storageKey` and returns two components: `WrappedStateProvider` and a hook function `useStateProvider`. The `WrappedStateProvider` component renders the `StateProvider`, passing in a computed initial state and an `onChange` callback. The initial state is calculated by retrieving a value from session storage and falling back to the `initialState` if no value is found. The `onChange` function updates the session storage whenever the state value changes. This utility allows React components to have a state that persists across page refreshes by synchronizing it with session storage.

# createStateProvider

The `createStateProvider` is a utility function that helps create a custom hook for providing and consuming state in a React context. It imports necessary functions from React, such as `createContext`, `useContext`, `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`. 

The function creates a context that holds the state and a function to update it. It then defines a `Provider` component that uses the props `children`, `initialState`, and `onChange`. Inside the component, it creates a state and its setter using `useState`, creates a custom hook to run the `onChange` function whenever the state is updated, and sets a memoized array as the value provided to the context.

The function returns a tuple `[Provider, useStateProvider]`, where the first element is a provider that handles its own state and can be consumed by other components, and the second element is a hook that consumes state from the context. This allows you to have a global state or multiple contexts with their own states, which can be accessed from any component in your application.

# createValueProvider

The `createValueProvider` utility function is a convenient way to construct a Context Provider and its associated hook in React applications. It takes an optional `defaultValue` parameter and creates a new Context with that default value. The function then defines a `Provider` component that accepts two props - `children` and `payload`. It also creates a `usePayload` function, which is essentially a wrapper over the `useContext` Hook from React library to provide the value from the nearest Context. Finally, it returns a tuple with the `Provider` component and the `usePayload` hook for using the provided value. This allows developers to create a common pattern of provider and useX hook to access the context in a very concise and type-safe way.

# createWindowHistory

The TypeScript function `createWindowHistory` is a utility that determines the appropriate history object to use based on the current environment where your application is running. It checks if the `location` object is available in the global environment, and based on this information, it decides whether to use a Memory History or a Browser History.

A Memory History is a history keeper that works in memory of the device and is useful in non-browser environments, such as tests and React Native. It doesn't rely on a browser's URL bar to manage and maintain the history state.

A Browser History is used when your application is running inside a web browser. It can manage and maintain the history state using the URL of the web browser.

The function first checks if the `location` object is available in the globalThis object. The `globalThis` object is a standard name for the global object in different JavaScript environments, such as `window` in a browser and `global` in Node.js.

If there is no `location` (which usually means we are not in a web browser), it chooses a Memory History as it's likely running in a non-browser environment. If the `location` is defined and its protocol is 'file:' (which usually means it is being run from a local file system), it also chooses a Memory History. If neither of those conditions is true, it chooses a Browser History, assuming it runs in a web browser where URLs are available.

This function is imported and used wherever history management is required, based on the environment it runs in. It helps make your application portable and flexible, as it can gracefully handle various environments where your application may run.

# crypt

The `crypt` function is a simple string encryption utility in JavaScript that takes two parameters: `salt` and `text`. It follows a series of operations to encrypt the input text. 

First, it uses a helper function `textToChars` to split the input text into an array of individual characters and then maps these characters into their corresponding ASCII values. 

Next, it applies a helper function `applySaltToChar` to perform a bitwise XOR operation on the ASCII codes of salt characters and the corresponding ASCII code of text's character. 

Finally, it converts the result of XOR operation to hexadecimal and joins the array into a single string, which represents the encrypted form of the original text. 

However, this encryption method is very basic and not suitable for high-security applications. It is recommended to use secure encryption libraries for stronger encryption.

# decrypt

The `decrypt` function in this Typescript utility takes two parameters: `salt` and `encoded`. The `salt` is a string used to modify the output when applied to the encoded text, and `encoded` is the string that needs to be decrypted.

Inside the `decrypt` function, there are three helper functions:
1. `textToChars` - this function accepts a string, splits it into individual characters, and maps them to their corresponding ASCII values using `charCodeAt(0)`.
2. `applySaltToChar` - this function accepts a code (ASCII value of char), returns a new code which is the XOR of all ASCII values of `salt` and input code.

The function then proceeds to decrypt the encoded string by:
1. Breaking the `encoded` string into an array of two-character groups using the `match` method with regex `/.{1,2}/g`. This regex tells the `match` method to form groups of exactly 2 characters.
2. Using `map`, it converts each group of two characters from hexadecimal to decimal representation using `parseInt(hex, 16)`.
3. It then applies the `applySaltToChar` to each decimal number. The `reduce` function performs the XOR operation with each character's ASCII of `salt`.
4. Using `map` again, it converts each decimal number to string representation using `String.fromCharCode(charCode)`.
5. Finally, it joins all the characters back into a single string using `join("")`.

The functionality of this code is a basic encryption/decryption method that relies on the XOR operation. The encryption strength entirely depends on the `salt` used. If the `salt` is unknown, it will be hard to decrypt the encoded (encrypted) text. However, if the `salt` is known, the decryption can be performed easily.

# datetime

This utility provides two classes, `Time` and `Date`, to represent specific points in time and dates respectively. The `Time` class has properties for hour and minute, with methods to convert the time object into a string, total minutes representation, and static method to create a new `Time` object from total minutes. The `Date` class has properties for day, month and year, with similar methods to convert the date object into a string, total days representation, and static method to create a new `Date` object from total days. Additionally, there are helper functions for parsing, serializing and stamping operations. The code also uses regular expressions and the `dayjs` library for date and time manipulation.

# deepClone

deepClone is a utility function in TypeScript that creates an exact copy of a given object. This deep clone ensures that any changes made to the original object will not affect the copied one, and vice versa. This is different from a shallow clone, which may share references to complex types like sub-arrays and sub-objects.

The function `deepClone` takes one input, `src`, of type `any`. It creates an empty object, `target`, which will be populated to become an exact copy of `src`. It then iterates over each property of the source object using a for-in loop. For each property, it checks if the object has its own property (not inherited) and if the property is an array or an object.

If the property is an array, a shallow copy of it is made using the `slice` method and set to the corresponding property in the target object. If the property is not an array but an object, the function calls itself recursively to copy over nested objects. If the property is neither an array nor object, it is directly assigned to the corresponding property in the target object.

However, there is a note in the comments that mentions the function currently does not support cloning arrays of objects. The `isObject` function, which is imported at the bottom and checks whether a given value is an object, may be used to support this functionality in the future.

# deepCompare

The `deepCompare` function is a utility used to deeply compare two objects and determine if they are identical in structure and values. It takes two parameters, `obj1` and `obj2`, and checks if they are identical by reference, null or undefined. If they are objects (of any type, including arrays and functions), it compares the number of keys in both objects. If they have a different number of keys, it returns false. For each key in `obj1`, the function recursively calls itself with the values of `obj1[key]` and `obj2[key]`. If any deep comparison returns false, the function immediately returns false. If all deep comparisons return true, the function returns true.

The `shouldComponentUpdate` function is a lifecycle method of the `AutoSizer` component in React. It determines whether a component's output is affected by changes in state or props, and if not, it prevents unnecessary rerenders for performance optimization. It first checks if the state-related conditions have changed and returns true if they did. If not, it uses the `deepCompare` function to compare complex object props. If any deep comparison returns false, the function returns true.

The `IAutoSizerProps` interface defines the expected properties for the `AutoSizer` component.

The `State` type represents the state values of an object with specific parameters such as height, width, childHeight, and childWidth.

The given Jest tests demonstrate example usages of the `deepCompare` function in a testing scenario.

The `private _patchSizeRequest` function is used to set the values of the last height request and last width request based on the passed properties. It is often useful where we have to manage some internal component behavior based on prop values.

Together, these elements along with numerous imported modules make up a complex application involving deeply compared objects, rendering logic based on changing prop and state values, and deep cloning of objects.

# deepFlat

The `deepFlat` utility in TypeScript is a function that takes an array of objects and returns a flattened version of the same data. It uses a recursive approach to handle nested objects, ensuring that all items are included in the final result. The function is generic and can work with any type of object, defaulting to `any` if no specific type is provided. The utility follows a depth-first traversal pattern, processing each entry in the array and its nested 'fields' and 'child' properties. The function is tested with various types of nested field structures to ensure correct flattening. However, it assumes that the objects in the array have 'fields' and 'child' properties, so it may not behave as expected with objects that do not adhere to this structure.

# deepMerge

The `deepMerge` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to merge multiple objects into one, recursively. It takes a target object and one or more source objects, merging the properties of each source object into the target. If both the target and source are objects, it loops through each property of the source object. If a property's value in the source object is an array, it copies this array into the target object. If it's an object, the function recursively calls itself with the corresponding property of the target object and the source object. If it's not an object (a primitive value), it assigns this property's value from the source to the target object. The function then calls itself recursively with the target and remaining source objects, or returns the merged object if no more objects are left. This utility is useful for deep cloning objects or merging multiple objects into one, with conflicting properties taking the value from the last source object.

# downloadBlank

The `downloadBlank()` function in TypeScript is designed to download a file from the specified URL and save it with a given file name. It is used in the context of a web application and runs within the browser. The function accepts two parameters, `url` and `name`, both of which are strings.

First, the function checks if `overrideRef` is defined. If it is, the function calls `overrideRef` with `url` and `name` as arguments, then terminates. This can be used to substitute the standard download behavior with custom logic, but in this provided code, `overrideRef` is not defined.

If `overrideRef` is not defined, the function proceeds to download the file from the provided `url` using the Fetch API's `fetch()` method with the options object `{ mode: 'no-cors' }`. This option allows for "opaque" responses that cannot be inspected.

After the request is made, the function transforms the response to a Blob using `response.blob()`. It then determines the file type using the `fileTypeFromBlob()` function imported from "file-type/core". If the type cannot be determined, it uses the original Blob's type instead.

A new Blob is created using the original Blob and the determined type. The function creates a Blob URL for it using `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`. An anchor (`a` element) is created in the document with the Blob URL as its `href` attribute, the passed file name as its `download` attribute, and the style set to `display: none`. The target attribute is set to `_blank` to ensure the file download happens in a new browser tab or window.

The `a` element is added to the document, and before it's clicked programmatically to initiate the download, an event listener is set up to clean up the Blob URL after the click. Finally, the `a` element is clicked programmatically, triggering the download of the file in a new browser tab or window.

The function does not return any value, and any errors during the process would likely cause a rejected Promise, which isn't handled here and would need to be caught and handled where this function is called.

# errorData

The `errorData` function in TypeScript takes an Error object as input and returns an object containing only the enumerable properties of the input Error object. It first retrieves all property names from the Error object using `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`. Then, it initializes an empty object called `result`. Next, it iterates over each property name using `forEach()` and retrieves the property descriptor for that property using `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()`. If the property descriptor has a 'value' property, it adds that value to the `result` object with the same property name. Finally, it returns the `result` object containing all enumerable properties from the input Error object. This function is useful for extracting and normalizing error data for further processing or logging.

# fetchApi

The `fetchApi` is a utility function that simplifies making HTTP requests using the Fetch API in TypeScript. It is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, allowing you to specify the expected type of response if needed. The function checks whether the input is a URL, converts it to a string if necessary. It then builds the request options, including headers, and makes a fetch call. If the response is not OK, it throws an error. Otherwise, the response is converted to JSON and returned. If any error occurs during the process, it throws a custom `FetchError` that includes additional details about the failed request, such as the original error, the request details, and the response (if any). This makes debugging easier and provides more context for error handling.

# filterString

The `filterString` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to remove specific strings from a given data string. It takes two parameters: `data`, which is the target data string to filter, and `ignore`, which is an array of strings that you want to remove from the `data` string. The function uses a loop to split the `items` string at each occurrence of a string in the `ignore` array, effectively removing them. It then joins the resulting array back into a string and returns the filtered data string without any occurrences of the strings that needed to be ignored. This function is pure, meaning it will always produce the same output for a given input and does not modify values outside of its scope.

# flatArray

The `flatArray` function is a utility that takes one or more arrays as input and returns a new array with all the elements flattened into a single level. It achieves this by using the `flat()` method of the Array object, which combines all sub-arrays into a single array, recursively going as deep as necessary. By setting the depth to Infinity, `flatArray` ensures that all nested arrays are flattened, regardless of how deeply they're nested.

# formatAmount

The `formatAmount` function is a utility that formats numerical values by adding decimal places and separating the thousands in the integer part. It takes two required parameters: `value` (a number or string) and `scale` (an optional integer representing the number of decimal places). The third parameter, `separator`, is also optional and represents the separator for thousands. 

The function first converts the `value` to a number and formats it according to the specified `scale` using the `toFixed` method. If the numerical value is less than 10,000, the formatted string is returned as it is. Otherwise, a regular expression replaces every position between two digits where the following digits' count is a multiple of three with the specified separator. The trailing ".00" is then removed, and the decimal point replaced with the specified separator.

This utility can be used to format currency amounts or any other numerical values that require formatting with decimal places and thousands separators.

# formatStr

The `formatStr` function is a utility that replaces placeholders in a given string with the corresponding values passed as arguments. It takes two parameters: the input string `str` containing placeholders and an array of values `args` that can contain strings, numbers or booleans. The function uses a `replace()` method with a regular expression to match and replace placeholders in the string. The callback function determines what each placeholder should be replaced with based on the type of placeholder (with or without a digit). The function can handle any number of arguments by using a rest parameter for `args`. An example usage of the function is provided where placeholders are replaced with corresponding elements from the `args` array.

# formatText

The `formatText` function is a utility that formats a raw string according to patterns provided in a template string. It takes three parameters: `raw` (the raw string to be formatted), `template` (the template string used for formatting), and `params` (optional customization options). The function uses the `IParams` interface to define the properties of the `params` parameter, which includes options for a symbol to indicate characters to be replaced, filtering of characters in the raw string using a function or regular expression, and replacing characters in the raw string using a function. The `formatText` function applies these customization options and formats the raw string based on the template, replacing specific characters with corresponding characters from the raw string. This function can be imported and used as a utility to format raw strings based on templates in various applications.

# get

The "get" utility function in TypeScript allows you to retrieve a value from an object by specifying its path. The function takes two parameters: the object you want to retrieve a value from and the path to that value, either as an array or a dot-separated string. 

The function dynamically sequences through the object to retrieve a nested value based on the given path and returns the value at the specified path or `undefined` if it doesn't exist. It first checks whether the path is an array, and if not, it splits the path string by '.' to generate an array of keys representing the path. Then, it uses `flatMap` to flatten the paths (if they are in a nested structure). 

Next, it uses `reduce` on the flattened array of keys with an initial value of the object. For each key in the array, it retrieves the value of the current object for that key. The `&&` operator ensures that if a key is not found in the object, the function will return `undefined` for that and all subsequent keys.

This utility function is useful when you need to access dynamic properties of nested structures in JavaScript and TypeScript, where the exact path to a property is not known until runtime and might vary over different objects.

# getAvailableFields

The `getAvailableFields` function is designed to filter and construct a list of available fields based on certain conditions involving provided features, data, and payload objects. It takes four parameters: `fields`, an array of data entities defined by the `IField` interface; `data`, a data object with string keys and any value; `payload`, a payload object with string keys and any value; and `_features`, optional features collected from the `features` property of the `IOnePublicProps` interface.

The function first calls the `resolveFeatures` function with `_features` as an argument, transforming the `_features` into a usable form. It then applies a `filter` function on the `fields` array, passing the resulting array along with `data` and `payload` objects into the `buildCommonResult` function. The filter function iterates over each field and checks if a field should be included in the final list or not. If a field doesn't have `features` or any of the features required by the field is already included in the main `features`, it allows the field to pass through the filter, making it available. The filtered list only includes the fields that have at least one feature that matches with the main features or fields that do not require any features.

The `buildCommonResult` function constructs two parts: `visible`, which includes fields that are visible and eligible based on the specified conditions, and `hidden`, which includes fields that are not eligible and hence, hidden. Finally, the `getAvailableFields` function returns this constructed object from the `buildCommonResult` function.

# getElementFromXPath

The `getElementFromXPath` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to retrieve the first HTML element matching a specified XPath expression. It takes an input string `xpath` representing the XPath expression to be matched against the document's elements. The function uses the `evaluate` method from the `document` object to search for the first element that matches the XPath expression. The function returns this first matching element, or `null` if no match is found. This utility can be useful for easily selecting specific elements within a document using XPath expressions.

# getErrorMessage

The `getErrorMessage` function is a utility that helps in gathering error message information from an error object of any type. It starts with a default error message of 'Unknown error' and checks the provided `error` object to see if it is a string or an object. If the `error` is a string, it assumes that the entire string represents the error message. If it is an object and not null, the function checks for error messages in several places within the object, such as `error.error.message`, `error.data.message`, and `error.message`. If it finds an error message in any of these places, it updates the `errorMessage`. Finally, it returns the updated `errorMessage` which can be used to provide more specific error information when handling exceptions in a generic way. The function can be imported and used in other parts of the application. The provided interfaces, `IProcess`, `IParams`, `IState` and `IError`, are unrelated to the `getErrorMessage` function and are likely used for other parts of the application. The `getPercent` function is also unrelated to the `getErrorMessage` function, although it may be used elsewhere in the application.

# getFilterCount

The `getFilterCount` function is a utility that counts the number of non-empty and non-ignored key-value pairs in a given filter data object. It takes two parameters: `filterData`, which is the object to filter, and `ignore`, a function that determines whether to ignore specific key-value pairs. The function initializes a `counter` variable at 0 and iterates over the `filterData` object using a for...of loop. It checks if the value is null, an empty string or false; if so, it continues to the next key. If the `ignore` function returns true for a key-value pair, it also skips to the next iteration. If none of these conditions are met, the `counter` is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the total count of non-empty and non-ignored key-value pairs in the `filterData` object.

# getInitialData

The `getInitialData` function is a generic utility that generates initial data based on provided field definitions and a payload. It accepts an array of field definitions and a payload, with the latter being optional as it defaults to an empty object. The function creates a new data object and populates it based on the provided field definitions.

First, it flattens the array of field definitions to ensure a single-level structure. Then, it filters out fields without a name property. For each remaining field, it checks its type, name, defaultValue, and hidden properties. If the field is hidden (either by a truthy value or the result of invoking its hidden function with the payload), it is skipped. Otherwise, the function determines the value to set for that field in the new data object.

If defaultValue is `undefined`, the function checks if a field with the same name already exists in newData. If it does, the existing value is used; otherwise, it calls `initialValue(type)` to retrieve the initial value. If defaultValue is a function, it invokes the function with the payload and sets its result as the field value. If defaultValue is neither `undefined` nor a function, it directly sets its value as the field value.

Finally, the function casts newData to its expected type (Data) and returns it. The implementation details of the `create`, `set`, `get`, `initialValue`, and `deepFlat` functions are not provided, but they are assumed to be used for specific tasks within the `getInitialData` function.

# getMediaContext

The `getMediaContext` function is a utility in TypeScript that helps determine the type of medium a device falls into based on its screen width. It takes an optional parameter, a set of breakpoints encapsulated in an object that follows the `IBreakpoints` interface. This object contains properties representing specific milestones in screen width typically used in responsive design, such as `xs` (extra small), `sm` (small), `md` (medium), `lg` (large), and `xl` (extra-large). If no object is provided, the function uses default values.

The `getMediaContext` function uses the `match` function to determine if the current window's innerWidth fits within a certain range. The `match` function is a simple boolean function that validates if the current window's width is between or equals the `from` and `to` parameters.

Finally, the function returns an object that represents the medium in which the device is being classified, indicating whether it's a phone, tablet, desktop, wide-screen, or mobile. This approach to system design is often used in web development to provide an optimal browsing experience for devices of various display sizes.

# getMomentStamp

The getMomentStamp function is a utility that helps calculate the moment stamp or time period between now and a specified end date. It uses the "dayjs" library, which is a popular JavaScript date and time manipulation tool. By providing an end date and a dimension, this function can determine the time elapsed or remaining until that date, making it useful for various time-related calculations in your code.

# fromMomentStamp

The `fromMomentStamp` function in TypeScript is a utility that allows you to convert a given timestamp into a specific moment in time using the `dayjs` library. It takes two arguments: `stamp`, which is a number representing the timestamp you want to convert, and `dimension`, which is a type from the `dayjs` library representing the unit of time you want to convert the timestamp into. If no `dimension` is provided, it will default to a predefined constant `DIMENSION`. 

Inside the function, it first creates a new `dayjs` object using the constant `GENESIS`, which represents a base or start point in time. It then adds the `stamp` to this base moment in time, using the specified `dimension` as the unit of time. Finally, it returns the resulting `dayjs` object representing the moment in time corresponding to the added timestamp.

# getRouteItem

The `getRouteItem` function is a utility that helps find the matching route from an array of routes based on a given pathname. It works by iterating through each route item and compiling the path of the current route into a regular expression using `pathToRegexp`. If the provided pathname matches any of the compiled regular expressions, it returns that route and stops further iteration. If no match is found for any route, it returns null. This function is useful in routing systems where you need to determine the appropriate route for a given pathname.

# getRouteParams

The `getRouteParams` function is a utility that retrieves route parameters from a given pathname based on a set of routes. It uses generic type `T` to allow any object as parameters and takes two arguments: `routes`, an array of route objects, and `pathname`, the path to extract parameters from. The function loops over each route, creates an empty object `params` of type `T`, and checks if the pathname matches the regular expression generated from each route's path. If there is a match, the function assigns each token to its corresponding key in `params`. If there is no matching route for the given pathname, it returns `null`. The function is used in the `RouteManager` class to fill the `_params` field with the relevant parameters of the current route.

# getTimeStamp

The `getTimeStamp` function is a utility that calculates the timestamp in minutes from a given date and time. It takes an optional argument `source`, which defaults to the current date and time if no argument is provided. The function uses the `dayjs()` function from the `dayjs` library to obtain the current date and time.

Inside the function, two variables `hour` and `minute` are declared to store the hour and minute values from `source`. These are obtained using the `get()` method from the `dayjs` library, which retrieves the hour and minute from `source`.

Finally, the function returns the total minutes calculated by multiplying the hour value by 60 and adding it to the minute value. This gives us the timestamp in minutes of `source`.

# fromTimeStamp

The `fromTimeStamp` utility function takes a timestamp as input and converts it into a date and time using the `dayjs` library. It accepts one parameter, `stamp`, which represents the timestamp you want to convert. The function returns the corresponding date and time based on the given timestamp.

To achieve this, a `genesis` constant is defined which represents the current date and time, but with the hour and minute set to 0. This essentially represents the start of the current day. The function then adds the number of minutes represented by `stamp` to the `genesis` using the `add` method of the `dayjs` library.

The `dayjs` library is a minimalist JavaScript library that handles date and time operations for modern browsers, with a largely Moment.js-compatible API. It is used for all date and time operations in this function. The `set` method is used to set a specific part (like hour, minute, etc.) of a Day.js object.

The function's code includes an import statement for the `dayjs` library and defines an exported function `fromTimeStamp` that accepts the timestamp as a parameter and returns the corresponding date and time.

# getXPathFromElement

The `getXPathFromElement` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to retrieve the XPath of a given HTML element. XPath, or XML Path Language, is a query language used to locate specific nodes within an XML document. In this case, it helps find the position of a particular HTML element within a web document.

To use the function, you need to provide an instance of the `HTMLElement` interface as a parameter. It will return either the XPath of the element as a string or `null` if it cannot be determined.

If the supplied HTML element is either "HTML" or the "BODY" of the document, it will return a corresponding XPath string.

For other elements, the function creates a `siblings` array containing the child nodes of the element's parent node. It then iterates through the `siblings` array and checks if each sibling is the same as the `element` and if it has a parent node. If so, the function recursively calls itself with the parent element and appends the element's tag name along with its index among the siblings to the XPath string.

If an element is not part of the document tree, the function will return `null`.

The XPath generated by this function follows the 1-indexing standard used in XPath.

# heavy

The `heavy` function is a TypeScript utility that allows for lazy loading of React components with suspense. It takes a `factory` function as its parameter, which should return a promise that resolves to the component you want to load lazily. Optionally, you can provide customization options such as the `loaderSize` for the loader.

Inside the function, it creates a lazy-loaded component using the `factory` function. This lazy-loaded component is then wrapped within a functional component that uses React's `Suspense` component. The `Suspense` component includes a fallback prop that displays a `LoaderView` while the component is being loaded. Once the `factory` promise resolves, React updates the UI with the now-loaded component.

This utility ensures type safety and provides IntelliSense, making it a generic tool for wrapping components to add lazy loading with a loading indicator.

# isEmpty

The `isEmpty` function in your TypeScript code is a utility that checks if an object is empty or not. It takes in an object as a parameter, where the keys can be either strings or symbols and values of any type. The function first checks if the object has any symbol properties using `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj).length !== 0`. If there are symbol properties, it returns `false`, indicating the object is not empty. Next, it checks if the object has any properties at all using `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).length !== 0`. If there are properties, it also returns `false`, indicating the object is not empty. If neither of these conditions are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the object is empty. This function can be used in conjunction with the `EventEmitter` class, which has a property called `_events` and a method called `hasListeners`. The `hasListeners` method uses the `isEmpty` function to determine if there are any listeners attached to the emitter. If `_events` is not empty (i.e., `!isEmpty(this._events)`), it returns `true`, indicating that there are listeners attached. If `_events` is empty, it returns `false`, indicating that there are no listeners attached.

# isObject

The `isObject` function in TypeScript is a utility that checks if the provided value, represented by `obj`, is an object or not. It takes one parameter, `obj`, of any data type and returns a boolean value. If `obj` is an object, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

To determine if `obj` is an object, the function uses three checks. Firstly, it employs the `typeof` operator to check if the type of `obj` is "object". This operator returns "object" for objects in JavaScript and TypeScript. The function then checks if `obj` is not null, as in JavaScript, `null` is considered an object. Lastly, it verifies that the prototype of `obj` is `Object.prototype`, ensuring that the object is not a function or an array, as their prototypes are different.

The `isObject` function can be imported and used in other modules or files within the project, providing a convenient way to check if a value is an object in TypeScript.

# isUndefined

The `isUndefined` utility function is a TypeScript tool designed to determine whether the input object, referred to as `obj`, is undefined or not. This function can be imported and used in other modules or files within a TypeScript project.

The function is defined using the `export` keyword, followed by a constant variable declaration `const isUndefined = (obj: any) => {}`. The `(obj: any) => {}` syntax represents an arrow function that takes a single parameter `obj` of type any, meaning it can accept values of any data type.

Within the function, `typeof obj === 'undefined'` is used to check the type of `obj`. The `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of its operand. In this case, it checks if `obj` is of type 'undefined'. If the condition evaluates to true, meaning `obj` is indeed undefined, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating that the object has a value other than undefined.

In summary, the `isUndefined` utility function allows developers to easily check if a variable has been assigned a value or not, returning `true` if the variable is undefined and `false` otherwise. This can be particularly useful in TypeScript projects to ensure proper type checking and avoid potential errors.

# list2grid

The `list2grid` function is a utility that takes in an array of `IColumn` objects and a payload, which is used for formatting. It transforms this data into a specific grid configuration by returning an array of `IGridColumn` objects. 

First, the function maps over each `IColumn` in the `columns` array and generates a unique `mockName` for each column by appending its index to the `field` property. If there is no `field`, it uses "unknown" as the prefix.

Next, it checks the `type` of each column. If it is an `Action` type, the function returns null. If it is a `CheckBox` type, the function returns an `IGridColumn` object with a label (either the column's `headerName` or the `mockName`), width, field, and a format function that returns a `Checkbox` JSX element.

For other column types, the function returns an `IGridColumn` object with similar properties to the `CheckBox` case, but the format function can present `Async` components, call a `compute` function, or return a simple field value.

Finally, the function filters out any columns that were mapped to null (those with type `Action`).

This transformation is important for displaying data in the user interface, as it normalizes and formats raw data into a structure that the interface components can easily work with.

# loadScript

The `loadScript` function is a utility in TypeScript that allows you to dynamically load external scripts into your webpage. It takes two parameters: `src`, which is a string representing the URL of the script file you want to load, and `async` (optional), a boolean parameter indicating whether the script should be loaded asynchronously or not. The function returns a Promise<void>, which helps handle asynchronous computations and their final values or reasons for failure.

Inside the function, a new script element is created using `document.createElement('script')`. The cross-origin attribute (`crossOrigin`) of the script is set to "anonymous" for anonymous fetching of the script. The function then adds two event listeners: 'load' for successful loading and 'error' for any errors during the loading process.

If `async` is set to true, the script will be loaded asynchronously. The script element is then appended to the body of the document using `document.body.appendChild(script)`. Finally, the source URL of the script is set to the provided `src` parameter.

In summary, the `loadScript` function enables you to dynamically load external scripts from a specified URL, providing a Promise-based interface to handle the completion or failure of the script loading process.

# mainColor

The `mainColor` function is a utility that allows you to set the main color theme of a web application. It takes in one parameter, `color`, which is a string representing any valid CSS color. This function modifies the HTML of your webpage by adding a `meta` tag and a `style` tag to the head section of your document.

The `meta` tag sets the theme color for your web application on mobile platforms, while the `style` tag applies a background color to your entire HTML document. The `color` parameter is used in both tags to ensure consistency throughout your application.

By using the `export` keyword, you can easily import and use this function in other files within your project. However, be aware that directly modifying the `document.head.innerHTML` can potentially expose your application to injection attacks if the `color` parameter is determined by user input. It's recommended to use more specific methods, like `document.createElement`, to reduce the risk of such attacks.

# normalizeText

The `normalizeText` function is a utility that takes in two parameters: `text` (a string) and `config` (an object representing the configuration for input formatting). The `config` object contains options for input formatting such as `inputFormatterSymbol`, `inputFormatterAllowed`, `inputFormatterReplace`, `inputFormatterTemplate`, and `inputFormatter`. By using the `Partial<IConfig>` type, all properties in the `config` object become optional.

The function applies the `inputFormatter` to each character of the input text string, normalizing it. If no `inputFormatter` function is provided, a default `formatText` function will be used. The `formatText` function utilizes the provided `template`, `symbol`, `allowed`, and `replace` options.

The function first checks if the `text` is a string. If it's not, the function initializes an empty string as the result. Then, for each character in the text, it applies the `inputFormatter` function and appends that to the result. Once all characters have gone through the `inputFormatter` function, the function returns the result.

To fully understand this function's functionality, one would need to see the implementation details of both `formatText` and `IConfig`. These interfaces and functions are imported from other modules, so understanding their specifications and behavior is crucial for a deeper understanding of the `normalizeText` function.

# objects

The "objects" function is a TypeScript utility that recursively processes an object and its nested properties. It takes one parameter, "root", which is the object to be processed. The function initializes a "result" variable with the "root" object, which is ultimately returned as the result of the function.

The "objects" function defines an inner function called "process". This function takes in an "entry" (a nested value within the object) and a "change" callback function. The purpose of the "change" callback is to update either the "result" or the current "entry" in place.

Inside the "process" function, it checks if the "entry" is an object and not null. If the "entry" is an array, it iterates over the elements using "forEach". For each element, it recursively calls "process" and applies the "change" callback to the element at the corresponding index (idx), creating a copy of the entry array.

If the "entry" is an object (but not an array), it iterates over the entries of the object using "Object.entries" and "forEach". For each pair, the "process" function is called recursively for the value "v", and the "change" callback is updated to the array's element at the key "k".

After defining the "process" function, it is immediately invoked with "root" as a parameter. Finally, the function returns "result", which has been updated throughout the recursive processing of the "root" object.

This function is useful for deeply iterating over an object's properties and transforming them in a certain way, determined by the "change" callback. It provides a flexible and powerful way to handle operations that need to inspect every value in an object, regardless of how nested it is. The actual transformation depends on the "change" callback passed in each recursive call.

Please remember that this function uses any TypeScript type in several places, which suggests that it can be used with objects of different shapes. However, it also means that there's no type safety on those points. To maximize the benefits of TypeScript's type system, consider defining interfaces that adequately describe the "root" object's shape.

If you need a more detailed explanation or have any further questions, please let me know.

# openBlank

The `openBlank` function in TypeScript is designed to open a specified URL in a new browser tab. It takes the desired URL as a string argument and utilizes the `document.createElement()` method to create an anchor element with the URL set as its `href` attribute and the target set to '_blank' for opening in a new tab. The anchor element is then appended to the document body, programmatically clicked to initiate the opening of the URL, and finally removed from the document body to avoid any visual impact. This utility function can be imported into other modules for use throughout a project that involves front-end development with React and other related libraries.

# parseRouteUrl

The `parseRouteUrl` function is a utility that takes in two parameters: `template` and `url`. The `template` represents a route pattern that will be used to match against the provided `url`. This function is exported, meaning it can be imported and used in other modules or files.

Inside the function, it uses the `match` function from the `path-to-regexp` package to compare the `url` against the `template`. The configuration object passed to the `match` function specifies that the URL should be decoded using `decodeURIComponent`, which is a function that decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component that was previously created by `encodeURIComponent` or a similar routine in any JavaScript context.

If a match is found, the result of `match` will be returned. However, if no match is found, the `match` function will return null.

The provided examples demonstrate the usage of `parseRouteUrl` by calling it with specific route templates ("/file", "/pdf", "/image", "/video", "/audio", and "/error") and then converting the result to a Boolean using the `!!` operator. Each call effectively checks if the provided URL matches a specific route template and returns a Boolean indicating whether there is a match or not.

# preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures

The `preventBrowserHistorySwipeGestures` function in TypeScript is a utility that prevents the default browser actions triggered by swipe gestures at the edge of the screen. It achieves this by adding a touchstart event listener to the window, which checks if a single touch point is within the left or right 10% of the screen. If it is, the default behavior of the touch event on the edge of the screen is prevented, thus stopping browser history swipe gestures. The function also provides a way to remove the event listener at any time, allowing you to disable this behavior when needed.

# randomString

The `randomString` function generates a random string by utilizing the `uuid` library, which is commonly used for generating unique UUIDs. This function returns a randomly generated string that can be used for various purposes, such as creating unique user IDs or file names. The `uuid` library's `v4` function is imported and renamed to `uuid`, which generates a random UUID.

# range

The `range` function is a utility in TypeScript that generates an array of numbers within a specified range. It takes three parameters: `start`, `end`, and an optional `length`. The `start` parameter defines the starting point of the range (inclusive), `end` defines the ending point of the range (exclusive), and `length` determines the length of the generated array. By default, `length` is set to the difference between `end` and `start`. The function uses the `Array.from` method to create an array with the calculated elements based on the `start` value and index. This utility can be used to generate arrays in a way that is compatible with Python's range function.

# reloadPage

The `reloadPage` function is an asynchronous utility that allows for the reloading of a webpage. It first sets the `isReloading` variable to true and checks if the `overrideRef` exists. If it does, the function executes whatever code is defined in `overrideRef` and stops further execution. 

The function then retrieves the current URL's `href`, `origin`, and `protocol` from the browser's `window.location`. If the protocol is not "file:", it creates a new `URL` object from the current URL and modifies it to point to the root page ("/") and clears any search strings or hash fragments. It then sets the `window.location.href` to the modified URL, effectively navigating the browser to that page.

If the protocol is "file:", it simply calls `window.location.reload(true)` to perform a hard reload, bypassing the cache.

This function is used in various parts of the code to refresh data from a server, clear local state, or update the webpage with new information. For example, if an error occurs while trying to set a new item in local storage or session storage, it clears the storage and reloads the page.

# removeExtraSpaces

The `removeExtraSpaces` utility in TypeScript is a function designed to remove all extra spaces from a given string. It takes in one parameter, `str`, which is the input string from where extra spaces need to be removed. 

The function uses a `do...while` loop to continuously remove extra spaces until there are no more changes in the length of the string before and after removing spaces. Inside this loop, the current length of the string is stored in `prevLength`. Then, the function splits the string into an array of substrings wherever it encounters two spaces using `split("  ")`. After that, it joins these substrings back into a single string with only one space in place of the original two spaces using `join(" ")`. 

Once the loop ends, the modified string `str` with extra spaces removed is returned.

# removeSubstring

The `removeSubstring` utility function is designed to remove specific substrings from a given input text. It takes two parameters: the `text` to be modified and an array of substrings `remove` that need to be removed from the text. The function uses a `forEach` loop to iterate over each substring in the `remove` array. For each substring, it splits the `result` string into an array of strings at each occurrence of the substring, joins these strings without the substring (replacing it with an empty string), and trims any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified `result` is then returned as the output of the function. This utility can be useful for removing common words, phrases or characters from a text while preserving the original structure of sentences.

# replaceSubstring

The `replaceSubstring` function is a utility that replaces occurrences of one or multiple substrings within a given string with new substrings. It takes three parameters: `str` (the original string), `from` (the substring or an array of substrings to be replaced), and `to` (the new substring or an array of substrings replacing the old ones). 

The function first initializes a new string `result` with the original input string. It then creates two arrays, `fromChunks` and `toChunks`, by transforming the `from` and `to` inputs into arrays of strings using a helper function called `flatArray()`. 

Next, the function checks if the lengths of `fromChunks` and `toChunks` are equal. If they're not, it means there are more `from` substrings than `to` substrings. In this case, the function replaces each `from` substring with the first `to` substring (or an empty string if there are no `to` substrings) using the `split()` and `join()` methods. 

If the lengths of `fromChunks` and `toChunks` are equal, it means each `from` substring has a corresponding `to` substring. In this case, the function replaces each `from` substring with its corresponding `to` substring.

Finally, the function returns the modified string. The `flatArray()` helper function is imported from an external module, but its implementation details are not available in this description.

# roundTicks

The `roundTicks` function in TypeScript is a utility that allows you to format a given price as a string with a fixed number of decimal places. It takes two parameters: `price`, which is the numerical price you want to format, and an optional `tickSize` parameter that defines the number of decimal places (default is 8). Inside the function, it creates a new instance of `Intl.NumberFormat` with the 'en-US' locale, instructing it to return a string representation of the `price` rounded to have exactly `tickSize` decimal places. The function then returns this formatted string, providing a clear and concise representation of the price with the specified decimal precision.

# set

The "set" function in TypeScript is a utility that allows you to update the value of a specific property within a deeply nested object. It takes three parameters: the "object" you want to update, the "path" to the property you want to modify, and the "value" that you want to set for this property. The "path" can be a string with dot-separated levels or an array of strings representing each level in the object. The function splits the "path" into constituents, ensuring a consistent format of flattened array of strings. It then uses the "reduce" method to traverse through the nested object until it reaches the desired property. If the property exists, it assigns the new "value" and returns true. If the property does not exist, it catches any errors and returns false. This function provides a convenient way to update values in complex nested objects without having to manually traverse through each level.

# sha256

The `sha256` function is an asynchronous utility that computes the SHA-256 hash of a given message. It can be useful for data integrity checks or password storage. The function takes a string as input and follows these steps:
1. Encodes the input message into a `Uint8Array` of bytes using the TextEncoder.
2. Computes the SHA-256 hash of this byte array using the `crypto.subtle.digest` method, which returns a Promise that resolves to the hash as an `ArrayBuffer`.
3. Converts the `ArrayBuffer` into a regular array of bytes (`Uint8Array`) for easier manipulation.
4. Converts each byte in the array into a hexadecimal string, pads it on the left with zeroes to ensure it's two characters long, and then concatenates all these strings together to form the final hash.
The `sha256` function returns a Promise that will eventually resolve to the hash string, representing the SHA-256 hash value of the input message.

# sleep

The provided Typescript utility is a function called `sleep` that allows you to pause the execution of asynchronous operations for a specified amount of time. It takes an optional parameter `timeout`, which represents the duration in milliseconds to pause execution. If no specific `timeout` value is provided, the default duration will be 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second).

The `sleep` function utilizes the built-in JavaScript `setTimeout()` function, which performs a provided callback function after a specified delay. In this case, the `sleep` function returns a Promise that resolves after the `timeout` period has elapsed.

This utility function provides a more convenient and readable way to pause execution compared to directly using `setTimeout`. It can be particularly useful in asynchronous operations where you need to introduce a delay before proceeding with further execution.

The code snippets you provided also include the definition of various interfaces and types, as well as import statements for specific methods from different modules. However, without the context of how these interfaces and methods are used in your program, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation of their purpose and functionality. If you have any specific questions about these sections, please feel free to ask.

# templateStr

The `templateStr` function is a TypeScript utility that allows you to create reusable templates by replacing placeholders within a string with values from one or more context objects. It takes a template string and one or more context objects as parameters, where each object is represented by a key-value pair. The function then merges all the context objects into a single object and replaces any placeholders in the template string with corresponding values from this merged object. The placeholders are identified by curly braces containing alphanumeric characters, underscores or hyphens. If a placeholder's key is not found in the context object or its value is undefined, it will be replaced with an empty string. This utility is useful for generating dynamic content, such as emails or user interfaces, by populating them with data from different sources.

# toRouteUrl

The `toRouteUrl` utility function, which can be imported and used in your application, generates a URL by combining a template string and a parameters object. It first uses the `compile` function from the "path-to-regexp" library to convert the template string into a regexp, with `decodeURIComponent` as the encoding option. Then, it calls this compiled function with the parameters object to generate the final URL string. This is useful for creating dynamic URLs by filling in the placeholders from the template string with values provided in the parameters object.

# typo

This TypeScript utility provides a namespace containing various constants related to typography. These constants can be used in your code to ensure consistent and accurate typography across different platforms, languages, or text formats. By utilizing these constants, you can easily apply typography rules and maintain a uniform appearance in your text output.

# waitForBlur

The `waitForBlur` function is a useful utility that allows you to wait for an HTML element, specified by its reference (`ref`), to lose focus or be removed from the document body. It takes an optional parameter `debounce` which determines the time interval in milliseconds for checking if the blur condition is met. By default, it checks every 50 milliseconds. The function returns a Promise that gets resolved when either the active element in the document is not the referred HTML element or it's contained within, or the referred element is not contained within the document body. This can be particularly helpful when you want to perform an operation after an element loses focus or is removed. You can use `await` or a `.then()` to execute your operation once the Promise is resolved.

# waitForSize

The `waitForSize` function is a utility that waits for an HTML element to have a non-zero size before proceeding. It takes an `HTMLElement` as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves when the size (either width or height) of the element is non-zero. The function sets up an interval that checks the size of the element every 50 milliseconds until it becomes non-zero, at which point the interval is cleared and the Promise resolves. This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to perform an action with an HTML element once it has a non-zero size, which typically occurs when the element gets rendered and becomes visible in the DOM.

# waitForMove

The `waitForMove` function in TypeScript is an exported utility that allows you to connect a callback function (`fn`) to an event source called `moveSource`. This `fn` function will be executed every time a move event occurs. The `moveSource` is a combination of multiple event sources, including `mouseSource`, `touchSource`, and `scrollSource`. 

The function keeps track of the number of times an event is emitted from any of the merged sources using a counter called `count`. It will execute the callback function (`fn`) after a specified number of `MOVE_DELTA` counts. 

In summary, `waitForMove` acts as an event listener, waiting for a move event to occur after the specified number of `MOVE_DELTA` counts from any of the merged event sources.

# waitForTab

The `waitForTab` function is a utility that allows you to wait for the "Tab" key press event and execute a callback function when it occurs. It does this by creating a unicast source of "keydown" events specifically for the "Tab" key. This source is then connected to the provided callback function, ensuring that it will be executed whenever the "Tab" key is pressed. The function uses a series of chained methods and functions to create the source, including `Source.unicast()`, `Source.create()`, and `Source.fromEvent().connect()`. The resulting source is shared, meaning that the "Tab" keypress events will be dispatched to all connected event handlers. This utility is useful in scenarios where you need to wait for a specific key press event before executing certain code.

# waitForTouch

The `waitForTouch` function in TypeScript is a utility that allows you to wait for a touch event, such as when the user touches the screen or clicks the mouse button, and then execute a specific function. It takes another function, `fn`, as an argument. This `fn` function should have no parameters and not return anything. 

To achieve this, `waitForTouch` connects to an event source called `touchSource`, which is an observable that emits touch or click events. By hooking up the `fn` function to execute whenever the event source emits, `waitForTouch` ensures that the provided function will be called whenever a touchstart or mousedown event occurs.

In summary, `waitForTouch` is a useful utility for waiting and reacting to touch events in TypeScript applications, allowing you to execute specific functionality when the user interacts with your app.

# wordForm

The `wordForm` function is a utility that takes in a numeric value and an object containing three properties: `one`, `many`, and an optional `two`. The function determines the appropriate word form to use based on the numeric value. If the number is 0 or between 11 and 19 (inclusive), it uses the `many` form. If the last digit of the number is 0, it uses `many`. If the last digit is 1, it uses `one`. If the last digit is between 2 and 4 (inclusive), it uses `two` or falls back to using `many` if the `two` property is not provided. The function then returns a string that combines the number and the appropriate word form. This utility can be used in scenarios where you need to provide proper labeling for quantities, such as indicating how many items have been selected.
