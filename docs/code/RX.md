- ### BehaviorSubject

`BehaviorSubject` is a TypeScript class extending `Subject` and implementing `TBehaviorSubject` and `TObservable` interfaces. It serves as an observable allowing multiple observers to subscribe. Observers can access the current value (`_data`) and receive any new values published. When a new value is published, `next()` is called with the new value.

Features of `BehaviorSubject`: 

1. **_data  Field** : Stores the current value of the `BehaviorSubject`. 
2. **data Method** : Getter returning the current value. 
3. **next Method** : Updates `_data` with a new value and asynchronously calls `next()` of the super `Subject` class. 
4. **toObserver Method** : Creates a new observer, setting an `unsubscribeRef` function to disconnect it. The observer emits the current `_data` value (if any) and any new data passed by `next()`.

In Reactive Programming, `BehaviorSubject` maintains and shares a current state, ensuring new subscribers receive the current value and any subsequent updates.

### EventEmitter

The `EventEmitter` class facilitates event-driven programming in TypeScript. It allows objects to emit events and notify subscribed listeners. Key methods and properties include: 

1. **_events Property** : Maps event names to arrays of listener functions. 
2. **hasListeners  Getter** : Checks if listeners are attached. 
3. **getListeners Method** : Retrieves listeners for a specific event. 
4. **subscribe Method** : Subscribes a callback function to an event. 
5. **unsubscribe Method** : Removes a callback from an event. 
6. **unsubscribeAll Method** : Clears all event handlers. 
7. **once Method** : Subscribes a callback to an event, executing it only once. 
8. **emit Method** : Triggers an event with optional arguments.

Use `EventEmitter` for handling events and notifying listeners, commonly employed in both frontend and backend development.

### Observer

The `Observer` class facilitates asynchronous programming in TypeScript, allowing data flow to multiple listeners. Key features include: 

- **Data** : Allows creation with a specific data type. 

- **broadcast  Property** : An instance of `EventEmitter` for emitting events. 
- **isShared and hasListeners Getters** : Check state and listener availability. 
- **constructor(dispose: Fn)  Method** : Initializes with a dispose function to clean up when unsubscribed. 
- **LISTEN_CONNECT and LISTEN_DISCONNECT Methods** : Listen for connect and disconnect events. 
- **_subscribe and _unsubscribe Methods** : Add and remove callback functions from listeners. 

- **Transformation Methods** : `map`, `flatMap`, `reduce`, `mapAsync`, etc., for data manipulation.

`Observer` is designed for publishing data to multiple listeners asynchronously, commonly used in JavaScript/TypeScript async programming.

### Operator

The `Operator` class in TypeScript provides various static methods for manipulating collections of data. Each method corresponds to a specific operation: 

- **take** : Selects a certain number of elements. 
- **skip** : Skips a certain number of elements. 
- **pair** : Pairs elements in a collection. 
- **group** : Groups elements based on criteria. 
- **strideTricks** : Performs some striding operation. 
- **distinct** : Finds or removes duplicate elements. 
- **liveness** : Purpose unclear from the name. 
- **count** : Counts elements in a collection.

Specific functionality depends on the imported functions from respective modules (`take`, `skip`, etc.).

### Source

The `Source` class provides utility functions for creating and manipulating Observers. Key methods include: 

1. **merge** : Merges multiple observers into one. 
2. **join** : Combines values emitted by multiple Observers into one, with options for racing or buffering. 
3. **unicast** : Creates a unicast observer. 
4. **multicast** : Creates a multicast observer. 
5. **createHot** : Creates a hot observable. 
6. **createCold** : Creates a cold observable.

These methods help in managing and combining data streams represented by Observers.

### Subject

The `Subject` class implements the Observer design pattern, maintaining a list of dependents (observers) and notifying them of state changes. Key methods include: 

- **constructor** : Initializes state and methods. 
- **Transformation Methods** : `map`, `flatMap`, `reduce`, etc., for data manipulation. 
- **Subscription Methods** : `subscribe`, `unsubscribeAll`, `once`, etc., for managing subscriptions. 
- **`next` Method** : Emits data to subscribers.

It conforms to `TSubject<Data>` and `TObservable<Data>` interfaces, allowing handling of data of any type.
