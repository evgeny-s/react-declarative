# One

The `One` component is a generic React component that can work with different types of data. It has three generic type parameters: `Data`, `Payload`, and `Field`. The component receives a parameter `props` which should match the `IOnePublicProps<Data, Payload, Field>` interface.

The component first destructures the properties it needs, providing default values if they weren't provided. It then uses the `useActualCallback` hook to set up several callbacks, allowing for customization by providing a default function and the option to replace it with a custom one through `props`.

The component also checks for a `features` prop. If it's a function, the function is called. If it's an object, the keys are converted into an array where the corresponding value is truthy.

The component combines the overwritten callback props, non-overwritten callback props, and specific props into a `genesisProps`.

Finally, the component returns a rendered output that creates an `ApiProvider` and `PropsProvider`, nesting them in a `NoSsr` component. This provides context for other components to use data and renders the `OneGenesis` component using the same `genesisProps`.

This component is designed to be highly abstracted and flexible, allowing for a lot of customization regarding data handling and event management.

# Grid

The Grid component is a TypeScript JSX functional component designed for use in user interfaces, likely within a larger project focused on data display or management. It accepts a set of properties defined by the IGridProps interface and utilizes various hooks such as useSingleton, useSubject, useEffect, and useMemo. The component is highly versatile and customizable, allowing for efficient handling of large data sets. It provides features like column resizing, infinite loading, and row selection. The use of TypeScript Generics (<T extends RowData>) ensures that the data type used in this component is a subtype of RowData, providing flexibility in its implementation.

# ActionButton

The `ActionButton` is a React component that represents a button with specific actions tied to it, primarily for handling loading conditions. It accepts various callbacks (`onClick`, `onLoadStart`, and `onLoadEnd`) and flags (`disabled`, `throwError`) as properties. The component also includes a `Progress` sub-component to display a loading spinner when the button is in a loading state. The `onClick` handler is used to handle the button click event, while `onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd` are used to handle loading events. The component uses React hooks, such as `useState` and `useRef`, to manage internal state, prevent unnecessary updates after unmounting, and update the `isMounted` value when unmounting. The `handleClick` function is an async function that handles the button click event, with error handling in place to prevent potential errors from interrupting the functionality. The component extends the `ButtonProps` of `@mui/material/Button`, omitting the existing `onClick` property, and includes its own type definitions for the accepted props. Additionally, there is a `ProgressDefault` component that renders a linear progress bar when the loading boolean is set to `true`.

# ActionChip

The ActionChip component employs React's `useState` hook for managing state, allowing it to update the chip's value efficiently. To manage actions and loading states, it relies on a custom hook called `useSinglerunAction`, enabling smooth execution of actions with appropriate loading indicators. Depending on the loading state and the chip's value, different versions of the chip are rendered, each with specific configurations. Through careful optimization using `useMemo`, it ensures that rendering performance is maximized by computing certain props only when necessary. Overall, the ActionChip encapsulates a robust logic for handling interactive chips within a React application. Chip can be toggled if It stores value or presset if it is `withSingleValue`

# ActionFab

The `ActionFab` component is a customizable Floating Action Button (FAB) for React applications built using MUI's `Fab` component. It accepts various props such as `className`, `style`, `sx`, `noProgress`, `throwError`, `disabled`, `size`, `thickness`, and `color`. The component's functionality includes handling loading state, executing the `onClick` event when clicked, and displaying a loading progress indicator if specified. It also allows for custom child components to be rendered inside the FAB. The component uses hooks like `useStyles()`, `useState()`, and `useRef()` for styling, state management, and preventing memory leaks.

# ActionFilter

The ActionFilter is a React component that allows users to create and manage filters. It accepts several props such as the available filter actions, label text for the component and its "Add filter" button, initial filter data, a callback function to be triggered when the filter data changes, and additional properties for styling. The component uses multiple hooks to manage its state and lifecycle, including a custom hook for tracking changes in the filter data. It also includes functions to handle adding a filter, opening and closing the filter dropdown menu. The rendered JSX consists of a Box component containing elements for each filter action, an Autocomplete component to select the filter option, and an "Add filter" button that opens a menu with the available options. The component is highly modularized, with each part functioning based on the received props and internally managed state.

# ActionIcon

The `ActionIcon` is a React component that extends the `IconButton` from MUI and accepts a set of predefined props defined in the `IActionIconProps` interface. It has a specific behavior when clicked and supports handling its own loading state and error events. The component's appearance, behavior in different situations, and callback functions are controlled by various props. When a user clicks on the `ActionIcon`, it runs a `handleClick` function that implements loading and error handling. It calls a `onLoadStart` callback (if defined), increments the loading state, calls an `onClick` callback (which might be an asynchronous function), handles errors based on the `throwError` prop, calls a `fallback` function (if defined) or re-throws the error, decrements the loading state, and calls a `onLoadEnd` callback (if defined) with a boolean indicating whether an error occurred or not. The returned JSX element consists of a composition of `Box` and `IconButton` components, with a circular progress indicator shown or hidden based on the loading state and `noProgress` prop. Overall, the `ActionIcon` is a versatile component that allows users to create interactive buttons with built-in loading state and error handling.

# ActionMenu

The `ActionMenu` is a React Function Component that serves as an interactive dropdown menu. It utilizes TypeScript and JSX, accepting various props such as `options`, `transparent`, `disabled`, `throwError`, `fallback`, `onToggle`, `onAction`, `payload`, `className`, `style`, `sx`, `deps`, `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `keepMounted`, `BeforeContent`, `AfterContent` and `reloadSubject`. The component uses states to store the `anchorEl`, `loading` and a ref to store the reference of a button. It also includes several callback functions to handle user interactions and various tasks.

Upon clicking the `Fab` button, a dropdown menu is rendered using the `Menu` component, where options are passed as props. If there is an ongoing loading process, a loader (`CircularProgress`) is displayed until the content is hidden. For each option, an `Async` component is rendered to handle async-function or Promise, returning JSX in three states: loading, error, and success.

The `ActionMenu` provides a specialized interactive dropdown that encapsulates multiple behaviors, leveraging TypeScript's static typing for enhanced safety and readability.

# ActionStopIcon

The `ActionStopIcon` is a React functional component that represents an icon button with customizable properties. It accepts various props such as class name, style, sx (Material UI system prop), size of the icon, thickness of the progress spinner (if enabled), whether to show the progress spinner or not, if an error should be thrown during onClick execution, and if the button is disabled. The component uses Material UI's `Box` and `IconButton`, along with conditional rendering to display the icon and progress spinner based on the specified props. It also handles user clicks, loading states, and error handling as defined by the props.

# ActionToggle

The ActionToggle component is a stateful functional React component that utilizes TypeScript for type safety and Material-UI for its user interface. It manages the 'loading' and 'checked' states using React hooks, allowing the user to toggle between selected and unselected states. The component also handles asynchronous operations, unmounting, and error handling. It renders an interactive or disabled switch based on its state and receives various props that control its functionality and appearance.

# ActionTrigger

The `ActionTrigger` is a generic React component that allows rendering action buttons and handling callbacks based on user interactions. It accepts a single props object and renders action buttons with optional triggers. The component can also handle asynchronous operations and displays a loader while the operation is in progress. The `onAction$` callback is triggered when an action is selected, and the `createTriggerHandler` function creates a handler for each action. The `Trigger` component represents the actual button that can be enabled or disabled based on the `available` prop. The component is wrapped in a `Box` for proper layout and design. The provided code also shows the usage of `ActionTrigger` in another component called `Operations`, where it handles multiple actions and updates the component's state when an action is triggered.

# AlertView

The AlertView is a React component that displays a stack of alerts using Material-UI's Stack component. It accepts an object of IAlertViewProps as its props, which includes the StackProps interface and additional properties for alerts (items) and variant. The items property contains an array of IAlert objects, each with a color property for the alert's severity and a content property for the alert's text. The variant property can be set to 'standard', 'filled', or 'outlined' to change the visual style of the alerts. The AlertView component uses a custom CSS-in-JS hook, useStyles, to generate classes for styling. It hides the Stack component when there are no alerts (items.length is 0) by applying a hidden class with display: none; css. The AlertView component renders each item in the items array as an Alert component, with the severity and content of each item supplied by the individual IAlert items. The variant prop is set as the variant for the Alert component, and the color and content of each item are passed to severity and as the children of Alert, respectively.

# Async

The Async component is a TypeScript React higher-order function that manages asynchronous operations and renders components based on the state of those operations. It takes in several props such as loading, reloadSubject, children (a function that returns a Promise or Result), fallback (a function to handle errors), Loader and Error components, onLoadStart and onLoadEnd functions, payload (data to be passed to the children function), deps (dependencies of async data), and throwError (a boolean to indicate if an error should be thrown).

The Async component uses React hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and useLayoutEffect to manage the state of loading, error, and dependencies. It also handles the cancellation of previous operations when a new operation starts.

The render return of Async depends on the state. If loading is in progress, it renders the Loader component. If an error occurred, it renders the Error component. Otherwise, it executes the children function and renders its result.

Custom hooks like useReloadTrigger and useSubject are used, along with a subscription to the reloadSubject. Recursive dependencies are included in useEffect to respond to changes of payload, deps, and reloadTrigger.

The code uses TypeScript generics to provide type checking for the data payload (T) handled by the async operation. It also utilizes utility functions from 'react-dom' to flush updates synchronously after a promise is resolved, preventing batching of React updates.

# AuthView

The `AuthView` is a React functional component written in TypeScript that provides an authentication view for users to sign in. It accepts props defined by the `IAuthViewProps` interface and returns JSX. The component is generic, allowing customizable data types for fields and handling operations.

The `AuthView` component uses a default props feature to set stated defaults if the provided properties are not given. It also includes a `handleAuth` function, which handles the authentication process and manages errors and status updates.

Inside `AuthView`, there is a nested component called `Content`. This component handles the layout of inputs and the sign-in button, maintaining a state for data and having change (`handleChange`) and invalidation handlers (`handleInvalid`).

The rendered JSX includes a layout with components like `Logo`, inputs from the `Content` component, and is wrapped in several other components.

The `IAuthViewProps` interface describes the expected types and properties in the props passed to `AuthView`. The code also uses the `makeStyles` hook from Material UI to create a styling hook for the component.

The `OneHandler` is a generic type representing a handler function or data object for specific operations within the `One` component.

The code imports various elements, types, and hooks from other modules for further functionality. The actual definitions of these imported elements might be in different files. Overall, the `AuthView` is a complex and flexible React component with multiple handlers and customizable layouts.

# AutoSizer

The AutoSizer is a React component that automatically adjusts the size of its children based on the parent element's size. It extends a generic React Component class, where `T` extends the unknown type. The component's state includes height, width, childHeight, and childWidth properties.

The props for this component include specifications such as children, className, defaultHeight, defaultWidth, payload, style, and resize options. The shouldComponentUpdate() function is used to decide whether the component should re-render based on changes to props or state. The componentDidMount() function executes once the component is mounted onto the DOM and sets up a ResizeObserver to monitor changes in the parent node's size.

The _onResize() method is called whenever the viewport size changes, calculating and setting new height and width values for the parent and child components. If these new sizes differ from the current state, it updates the state and calls the onResize function passed as a prop.

The render() method returns a <div> element with dynamically determined height and width, populated with additional content using the children() function from props. The div is adjusted to match the size of the parent container it is in based on the withContainerHeight and withContainerWidth props.

The componentWillUnmount() clears resources before unmounting by removing the resize listener. The component also has some private helper methods for managing and monitoring the size of the component and its parent. Overall, AutoSizer is a useful tool for keeping child component sizes in sync with their parent container's dimensions, particularly in responsive design setups.

# Breadcrumbs

The Breadcrumbs component is a TypeScript JSX code that creates a breadcrumb navigation with optional save button and action menu. It uses the IBreadcrumbsProps interface to define its expected properties, including functions for handling save, back, and action events, an array of available actions for the menu, a boolean to enable/disable save button, an object for passing data to actions, and optional properties like title, subtitle, content before and after the menu. The Breadcrumbs function is a functional React component that takes these props and uses the useStyles hook to style its elements. It returns JSX rendering for the breadcrumb component, including a Box to house the setup, MatBreadcrumbs for navigation with provided title and subtitle, a conditional Button for save functionality if needed, and mapped actions with isVisible and isDisabled intents bound to the payload. The useStyles function generates classes based on a preset theme, and this component is likely used in a larger project for multi-level navigation or workflows with additional save and action options.

# Breadcrumbs2

Breadcrumbs2 is a customizable React component that displays breadcrumb navigation. It can be used with any data type and is highly configurable. The component accepts a set of props, including styling options and callback functions for handling actions, loading states, and potential errors. It also includes an array of breadcrumb items and optional action buttons. The component uses the Async component to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data for the breadcrumb items. It generates a list of rendered breadcrumb items and an optional action menu based on the provided props.

# ConstraintView

The ConstraintView component is a responsive React component that adapts its content based on the size of the screen. It accepts three React components as props: `desktopView`, `tabletView`, and `phoneView`. These components will be rendered based on the screen size. The component also accepts an `onViewChanged` callback function, `params` for providing parameters to the view components, and `...otherProps` for passing additional props.

The component uses the `useTheme()` hook from '@mui/material' to access the current theme and `useMemo` hook to calculate whether the current screen size matches phone, tablet, or desktop breakpoints. It then renders the appropriate component based on the screen size.

The `renderContent` function is used to render the correct component based on the screen width. It can render a `Phone`, `Tablet`, or `Desktop` component depending on the device type.

The `lastView.current` variable is used to store the name of the last view that was rendered. When a view change occurs, the `onViewChanged` callback is invoked if a different view is being displayed.

If `params` are provided, the component directly calls `renderContent`. If not, it wraps `renderContent` inside an `AutoSizer` component, which may handle additional responsive design features.

Overall, the ConstraintView component provides a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, allowing for an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

# Copy

The `Copy` component is a React button that allows users to copy the content passed through its `content` prop to their clipboard. It is written in TypeScript and provides several optional properties such as `fullWidth`, `transparent`, `onCopy`, `onCopyClick`, `fallback`, `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, and `throwError`. The component uses the Material-UI library for its `Box`, `Typography`, and `Button` components.

When the button is clicked, it prevents default event propagation and starts the copy process. If the operation fails, it checks if `throwError` is set and either throws the error or executes the `fallback` function if defined. The component also uses CSS styles created using Material-UI's `makeStyles` hook.

The component's props are shaped by the `ICopyProps` interface, which extends from Material-UI's `BoxProps` (minus the `onCopy` property). The component also uses a helper function `copyToClipboard` to copy the content and a helper method `classNames` to join class names together.

# CopyButton

The CopyButton component is a React functional component that allows users to copy data to the clipboard. It utilizes React Hooks such as useState, useMemo and useEffect to manage state and handle events. The component is highly customizable, allowing users to specify the button's color, size, variant, tooltip delay and other attributes. When clicked, the button will copy the provided content to the clipboard and display a tooltip with the message 'Copied!'. The component also provides an optional 'onClick' prop that can be used to perform additional actions when the button is clicked.

# Countdown

The Countdown component is a functional React component that displays and manages a countdown timer. It accepts an object with properties such as className, children, expireAt (the end time of the countdown), onExpire (a function to be called when the countdown ends), and other optional props. The component uses hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect, useMemo and useCallback to manage the countdown state, set and clear the timer, calculate the timeout based on expireAt date and avoid unnecessary re-rendering. The countdown is displayed within a Box component from MUI, and the countdown timer is created using setInterval, which can be cleared with clearInterval when needed. The component also includes an AccessTimeIcon to visually represent the countdown and displays children or static content "00:00" when the timer goes off.

# DocumentView

The `DocumentView` is a React functional component that accepts an object of parameters defined in the `IDocumentViewProps` interface. It provides default values for certain props like `withFullScreen` and `withDelete`. The component utilizes pre-defined styles from the `useStyles` style constructor and manages states for `toggle` and `hover`. The returned JSX defines the user interface, including conditional rendering of elements like ActionMenu or ActionFab buttons based on certain conditions. Event handling functions like `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` are used. The component uses `AutoSizer` to create an iframe with height and width determined by the payload. The style props or class names are dynamic and depend on state values or provided props. In the `PdfView` component, it uses `DocumentView` to display a PDF inside an iframe, with the ability to view it in full screen and a download button for the document.

# DragDropView

The `DragDropView` is a TypeScript JSX component that allows users to drag and drop files or select them through a file explorer window. It takes in properties defined by the `IDragDropViewProps` interface and handles file drag and drop events. The component's properties include `className`, `style`, `sx`, `disabled`, `multiple`, `accept`, `onData`, and `onReject`. The `handleDrag` function manages the appearance of the component when files are dragged over it, while `handleDrop` and `handleChange` functions validate the dropped or selected files and call the appropriate callback functions. The UI component consists of a `Box` with a form, label, instructions, input element for file selection, and a drag zone overlay. Styling is done using the `makeStyles` hook, and state management is handled through the `useState` hook. The component also uses the `useMemo` hook for optimization and relies on additional utility functions like `classNames`, `randomString`, and modules from `@mui/material/styles`.

# ErrorBoundary

The `ErrorBoundary` is a React component that acts as an error handler for child components within its tree. It is implemented in TypeScript and has two interfaces, `IErrorBoundaryProps` and `IErrorBoundaryState`, which define the shape of its props and state. The `ErrorBoundary` class component extends React's `Component`, using the defined generics for props and state.

The `ErrorBoundary` component utilizes several lifecycle methods and functions. `getDerivedStateFromError` is a static method that gets called after an error occurs in a child component, allowing the `ErrorBoundary` to capture and record the error in its state. The constructor initializes the component's state and binds methods. `componentDidUpdate` checks if an error has occurred and sets up a listener on the `history` object to handle new errors.

The `componentDidCatch` method is triggered after an error has been thrown in a descendant component, enabling the `ErrorBoundary` to catch JavaScript errors that happen during rendering or in lifecycle methods and constructors of the whole tree below it. The `render` method determines what gets rendered to the DOM. If a render error occurs, it renders nothing (null), otherwise it displays the child components uninterrupted.

Overall, the `ErrorBoundary` component provides a way to gracefully handle errors in an application, log them, and show a user-friendly error message.

# ErrorView

The ErrorView component is a TypeScript React component that displays an error view in the application. It accepts several props such as appName, Logo component, className, style, sx, buttonLabel and contentLabel. The default values are provided for these props if not supplied. The component uses the makeStyles() hook from Material-UI to generate CSS styles, which are applied to the UI elements. The JSX returned by the function builds up the UI, wrapping it with PortalView and Box components. Inside the Box, there is a RevealView component containing Paper, Stack and other components that display the application logo, error message and a button to reload the application. The handleReload function provides a custom page reload functionality that handles reloading differently depending on the current page protocol.

# FadeView

The FadeView component is a customizable React functional component that allows you to render a fade effect on top of child elements within the view. It accepts various configurations for customizing the appearance and behavior of the fade effect. The component uses the IFadeViewProps interface to define accepted props, including CSS class names and style properties for customization, child elements to be displayed within FadeView, and configuration options for the fade effect itself. The component also utilizes custom hooks and mixes styling features from the @mui/system library with classNames for modularity and CSS rules. At render time, the fade effect and child elements are displayed within a flex container, providing a visually appealing and interactive user experience.

# FeatureView

The `FeatureView` is a React functional component written in TypeScript (TSX) that takes an object of props called `IFeatureViewProps`. This component is optimized using React hooks `useMemo` and `useCallback`. 

The `IFeatureViewProps` object includes properties like `changeSubject`, `outlinePaper`, `transparentPaper`, and more. The component uses `useMemo` to calculate the `fields` and `value` variables. The `useCallback` hook is used to create a memoized `handler` function and a `handleChange` function that handles changes of the `data`. These hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders and computations when props or state values update.

The component returns a JSX expression using the `<One />` component with various props calculated or directly passed from the parent. The `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks, the presence of a type `State`, and an imported functionality `createFeatures` from a helper module indicate that this component is part of a larger application and responsible for displaying a specific view related to features.

# FetchView

The `FetchView` is a React functional component written in TypeScript that simplifies the process of fetching and rendering asynchronous data. It utilizes TypeScript generics to provide strong typing for the data being handled. The component accepts multiple type parameters, such as `P`, `A`, `B`, and so on, which can be customized to define the types of payload and elements in the data array returned by its handler function.

The `FetchView` component has a generic signature of `<P extends any = object, A = any, B = any, C = any, D = any, E = any, F = any, G = any, H = any, I = any, J = any>`, allowing for default values to be provided if no specific types are given. It also defines an interface `IFetchViewProps<P, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J>` that includes various properties such as animation, className, style, Loader, and more.

Inside the component's body, it uses the `useState` hook to manage the current appearance state of certain elements. The `handleData` function is responsible for transforming the payload into an array of items and handling asynchronous data fetching. Additionally, the `handleLoadStart` and `handleLoadEnd` functions serve as event handlers for starting and ending data loading.

The rendered JSX within the component includes a 'Reveal' and an 'Async' component. The 'Async' component renders either a Loader or an Error based on the state of fetching. Once the data is successfully fetched, a function receives the fetched data as arguments and returns the JSX to be rendered.

Overall, the `FetchView` component is well-documented and employs TypeScript generics, React hooks, and render props to create a versatile solution for handling asynchronous data in a React application.

# FilesView

The FilesView component is a React functional component that manages and interacts with a list of files. It takes in props such as an array of file names, styling properties, callback functions for handling file uploads, removals, clicks and list changes. It also accepts properties for translating labels, file types to accept during uploads and whether multiple files can be selected. The component utilizes React hooks such as useState, useRef and useLayoutEffect for managing state variables, tracking component mounting and performing side effects. It renders a DragDropView component for dragging and dropping files, as well as a List component to display uploaded files. Each file in the list has an associated action for removing or handling click events. The file operations are wrapped in try-catch-finally blocks to handle errors, which can either be logged and handled or thrown based on a flag.

# HtmlView

The `HtmlView` React component is designed to render HTML content safely within a Material UI `Box` component. It accepts props of type `IHtmlViewProps`, which can be used to customize the component's behavior and handle information. The HTML content is stored in a state and sanitized before being set to ensure security.

The component uses React hooks, such as `useState`, `useRef`, and `useLayoutEffect` for managing state, references, and updating the component's lifecycle. It also utilizes `useEffect` to handle asynchronous processing of the `payload` and any items in the `deps` array.

When rendering, the component checks if `html` is truthy. If it is, the HTML content is rendered within a `Box` component using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop. If `html` is falsy, the component renders any passed `children`. All other props are forwarded to the `Box` component using the spread operator.

The `IHtmlViewProps` interface provides typechecking for the component's props, while `sanitize` is used to sanitize input HTML strings using the browser's Sanitizer API. The `Box` component from Material UI is a utility component for building layouts, and the `IConfig` interface provides typechecking for the application's configuration settings. The `Element` interface extends the standard `HTMLElement` interface by adding a `setHTML` method.

Remember that directly setting HTML from JavaScript can be dangerous due to potential script injection risks. Therefore, the component ensures that any renderable HTML is sanitized before being set to state. The code is written in TypeScript JSX, which allows writing JSX code in TypeScript for typechecking and improved safety.

# If

This React component is a reusable conditional renderer that takes in child components and evaluates a condition to determine which component to render. It supports handling true, false, loading and error states during rendering. The component uses TypeScript for strong typing and accepts properties such as components to render for different conditions, callback functions for events, and a payload that's passed to the evaluation function. The component manages internal state with hooks and uses an effect hook to create side-effects based on changes in the payload or any value in deps array. It renders different child props based on the condition and loading state, allowing for easy composition with other components.

# ImageView

The ImageView component is a React element that displays an image and provides optional interactivity. It accepts properties such as the image source (src), whether to enable full-screen view (withFullScreen), and whether to enable image deletion (withDelete). The component also allows for custom CSS classes to be applied using the className property.

The component uses React's useState hook to manage the state of hover or toggle view. The main rendering includes a Box container that holds the img tag for displaying the image. This Box also handles mouse enter and leave events to manage hover state.

Conditional rendering is used to add either an ActionMenu or ActionFab element if options are present and withFullScreen or withDelete are true. The ActionMenu provides a list of actions that can be applied to the image, while ActionFab provides buttons for going full-screen or deleting the image.

The classNames function is used to conditionally apply classes based on whether the image is toggled or hovered over. The useStyles hook is used to add custom styles to the components, controlling aspects like positioning, visibility, and transitions.

The ImageView component is used within another component to display images with properties obtained from formState. The useState, openBlank, and classNames are imported from 'react' and '../../utils', respectively. Styling is applied using makeStyles, and Box is imported from the Material UI library.

# InfiniteView

The `InfiniteView` is a React component written in TypeScript that allows for infinite scrolling and on-demand data loading. It uses React hooks, the Intersection Observer API, and various helper functions along with React and Material-UI components. This component is designed to handle large datasets where data isn't loaded all at once, but rather incrementally as the user scrolls.

The `InfiniteView` accepts several props, including custom styles and class names, the React nodes it wraps around (`children`), whether there is more data to load (`hasMore`), if data is currently being loaded (`loading`), subjects for horizontal and vertical scroll positions (`scrollXSubject` and `scrollYSubject`), and callback functions for requesting new data (`onDataRequest`) and for handling load start and end events (`onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd`).

The component observes an invisible `div` at the bottom of its children using the Intersection Observer API. When this `div` intersects the viewport, it triggers a data request. The `handleDataRequest` function is used to request data, and it's wrapped with the `useActualCallback` hook to ensure only the latest callback function is called. If a request fails and `throwError` is set, the error is thrown; otherwise, the error-handling function passed in `fallback` is called.

The elements within the `Box` component rerender whenever state changes or new props are passed, and the `children` prop is memoized using `useMemo`. The component also uses the `useEffect` hook to clean up any subscriptions and avoid memory leaks when unmounted.

The `useSubject` and `useActualValues` hooks are imported from other files. The `useSubject` hook manages and identifies updates to a subject's value, while `useActualValue` returns the most recent value for an object. The CSS is managed with `useStyles`, a hook generated from the `makeStyles` function from Material-UI.

In summary, the `InfiniteView` component is a flexible, reusable solution for implementing an infinite-scroll pattern in web applications, improving page load times and enhancing user experience when dealing with large datasets.

# LoaderView

The `LoaderView` is a React functional component that displays a loading spinner while an asynchronous process is running. It takes in several customization options through the `ILoaderViewProps` object, which includes properties like `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `handler`, `fallback`, and `throwError`. The component uses React's `useEffect` hook to execute the provided asynchronous `handler` function, and it also handles the callback functions `onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd`. The component returns a box with a CircularProgress spinner inside, which can be customized using props like `size`, `variant`, and `value`. The component also allows for additional customization through the `className`, `sx`, and `...otherProps` properties.

# ModalProvider

The `ModalProvider` is a higher-order component that provides modal handling functionality to its child components. It uses React's Context API to share a piece of state (`element`) and associated update functions (`handleElement`, `handleClear`, and `handleUpdate`) with the child components. The `element` state holds an instance of a React component or is null. The `handleElement` function updates the current state of `element`, while the `handleClear` function sets `element` to null. The `handleUpdate` function is obtained from a custom hook and forces the component to re-render. The child components wrapped within the `ModalProvider` can manipulate the `element` state as required.

# NoSsr

The `NoSsr` React component is a TypeScript class that intelligently handles server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). It takes in props defined by the `INoSsrProps` interface, which can optionally include a `ServerView` React component and children. The state of the `NoSsr` component is represented by the `State` interface, which includes a single property called `canRender` of type boolean.

Upon initialization, the `canRender` state is set to false, indicating that the component should not render client-side content initially. Once the component is mounted to the DOM, `componentDidMount` is called and updates the state to set `canRender` to true. The use of `requestAnimationFrame` ensures the state update occurs before the next repaint, causing a re-render.

The `NoSsr` component's render function checks the value of `canRender`. If it's true, the component returns the provided children. Otherwise, it renders the `ServerView` component.

In the context of server-side rendering, `NoSsr` initially renders the `ServerView` component on the server. Once the component is hydrated on the client-side and `componentDidMount` is executed, the component state updates and React re-renders the component on the client with the provided children.

The additional code you provided demonstrates how the `NoSsr` constructor is used in the application. It's part of a `render()` method in a component, and is used to wrap a complex hierarchy of provider components, ensuring that none of the enclosed elements are rendered on the server side.

# OfflineView

The `OfflineView` React component is designed to conditionally render child components or an optional `Offline` component based on the browser's online status. It utilizes `navigator.onLine` to determine the online status and can also optionally poll a specified URL to check for connectivity.

The component accepts props such as `children` (child components to be rendered when online), `onOnline` and `onOffline` (optional callback functions to be called when the browser transitions between online and offline states), `config` (optional configuration options for the component), `withPolling` (an optional boolean to enable polling for checking online status), and `Offline` (an optional component to be rendered when the browser is offline).

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to initialize a connection manager that listens for online-offline events or implements a polling mechanism to the specified URL for online status determination. If polling is enabled, the component regularly executes an HTTP request to the specified URL and updates the online status accordingly.

When rendering, if an `Offline` component is provided and the browser is online, it renders the child components passed to `OfflineView`. If the browser is offline, it renders the `Offline` component. If no `Offline` component is provided, it simply renders the child components irrespective of the online status. If initialization is not complete, it renders nothing.

This component can be useful in scenarios where you want to provide offline support or fallback content for users in case their device goes offline.

# OneButton

The OneButton component is a TypeScript React functional component that handles data of different types using generics. It displays a button with a popover containing a form that dynamically changes based on the fields prop. When the button is clicked, a form appears in the popover. The component accepts a type that includes properties like fields, handler, and optional properties such as onChange, onBlur, onFocus, and waitForChangesDelay. The component uses useState hooks to manage state variables like anchorEl, invalid, and payload. It also utilizes custom hooks like useAsyncValue, useSingleton, and useChange. The component uses useMemo to create memoized functions and displays the count of non-empty properties in data inside a Badge component wrapped around the primary button. The Popover component contains a One component with passed and mapped props. If there is an error or loading status from the useAsyncValue hook, the component returns null and does not render anything.

# OneIcon

The `OneIcon` component is a functional React component that accepts an object of properties defined by the `IOneIconProps` interface. It displays an interactive `IconButton`, and when clicked, it opens a `Popover` containing the `One` component. The `IOneIconProps` object includes properties such as `waitForChangesDelay`, `fieldDebounce`, `noBadge`, an array of field objects, `handler`, `payload`, `badgeColor`, `color`, `badgeOverlap`, `badgeSx`, and `oneSx`. The component also uses several hooks, including `useStyles`, `useSingleton`, `useState`, `useAsyncValue`, `useRenderWaiter`, `useActualValue`, `useChange`, and `useMemo`. These hooks help with local state, performance optimization, and fetching async data. The component's functionality is limited by the scope of code given, and some information regarding imported modules is outside the scope of this example.

# PaperView

The `PaperView` is a reusable React component that can be customized with different styles and properties. It uses the `forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element, allowing direct operations on it. The component accepts several props, including `className`, which applies styles to the component, and `outlinePaper` or `transparentPaper`, which determine the render characteristics. If `transparentPaper` is true, a basic `Box` component with specified class names is rendered. If `outlinePaper` is true, an outlined `Box` with a border is rendered. In all other cases, the standard `Paper` component from Material-UI is used. The `useStyles` hook generates classes for styling the component, and `classNames` is used to conditionally join class names. Any valid props for the `Paper` or `Box` components can be passed to the `PaperView` component using the spread operator. The `IPaperViewProps` interface defines the expected props for `PaperView`, including all properties from the `PaperProps` interface except for the `component` prop, as well as additional optional boolean props `outlinePaper` and `transparentPaper`.

# PingView

The `PingView` component in React and TypeScript is a higher-order component that checks the online status of an application by repeatedly calling a provided "ping" function with an optional payload. This component renders its child components when the application is online and displays an offline component when it's not.

To use this component, you need to provide a `ping` function for online status checking, child components to be rendered when the application is online, and optional `onOnline` and `onOffline` callbacks that will be invoked when the application's online status changes.

The `ping` function is called repeatedly with a default delay of 5 seconds. If the ping operation encounters an error, it can either throw the error or render a fallback component.

The `PingView` component initializes its state as offline and sets up a repeated ping process using `useEffect`. If the ping is successful, it sets the online status to true. If an error occurs during the ping operation, it sets the online status to false.

While the component is in an uninitialized state, it renders nothing. Once initialized, if the application is online, it renders its child components; otherwise, it displays the `Offline` component.

Overall, the `PingView` component provides a convenient way to manage and render different content based on an application's online status.

# PortalView

The `PortalView` is a React component that creates and manages a portal for rendering children components outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. It extends from the `React.Component` class and accepts props that match the `IPortalViewProps` interface. The component has a property called `element`, which is initially set to null and serves as a reference for the DOM element where children will be rendered.

When the component is unmounted, it removes the `element` from the `document.body` to avoid leaving behind orphaned elements. The `render` method creates a new div element and appends it to the `document.body` if no element exists yet. It then uses `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render the `children` props into this new DOM node, effectively creating a portal for the children to be rendered outside of their parent component's DOM hierarchy.

# RevealView

The `RevealView` is a React component that animates and reveals its child components. It accepts several props such as `children`, which are the child components to be rendered and revealed, `className` for additional CSS class names, `style` for inline styles, and `animation`, which specifies the type of animation to be used. The component also accepts `delay` and `appear`, with the latter being a boolean to control whether child components should be revealed.

The component sets up state and effects using React hooks. It uses `useStyles` to get CSS classes, initializes a state variable `appear` and its update function, sets up a ref to track if the component is still mounted, and uses `useLayoutEffect` to update the ref when unmounted. `useEffect` is used to start the reveal animation after a certain delay, only if the component is still mounted.

Finally, the component returns JSX that renders the `Reveal` component with props such as `className`, `style`, `animation`, and `appear`. Only when `appear` is true, it renders its children. The `Reveal` component handles the animation of child components, while `useStyles`, `sleep`, and `classNames` are likely custom hooks or functions for defining CSS-in-JS styles, delaying the execution of a function after a specific time, and combining class names respectively.

# ScaleView

The ScaleView component is a React function component that scales its children elements based on the size of the component. It accepts properties such as children, className, style, stretch (to determine if the scaled child elements should stretch to fill the container), and center (to determine if the scaled child elements should be centered within the container). The component uses React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state, calculate dimensions for scaling, and update the reference to the root HTML element. The returned JSX includes a div with the specified className, style, and ref. Inside this div is a Box element that wraps the children elements and applies scaling based on the component's size.

# ScrollAdjust

The ScrollAdjust component is a functional React component that adjusts the scroll behavior based on specified breakpoints. It uses the Material-UI makeStyles hook to generate CSS classes for styling. The component returns a div element with a className that is conditionally set based on the truthiness of the adjustForce variable. If adjustForce is true, the classes.adjustForce style will be applied; otherwise, the classes.adjust style will be applied. Inside this div, if adjustFiller exists and is truthy, it creates an additional element using the createElement function from React. The ScrollAdjust component is designed to handle scroll adjustments in a responsive manner, adapting its behavior based on the specified breakpoints.

# ScrollTopView

The `ScrollTopView` is a React functional component written in TypeScript. It renders a button on the page that allows users to scroll back to the top when clicked. The component accepts a set of props (`IScrollTopViewProps`) to determine its styling and functionality. It has default values for `color` (primary) and `size` (medium), and an optional `scrollTarget` prop to specify a different scroll target than the entire document. The component uses two hooks, `useState` and `useLayoutEffect`, to manage its internal state and add a scroll event listener to the window. When the button is clicked, it scrolls to the top of the target element. The component renders a `Fab` from the `@mui/material` library, with an arrow up icon inside it.

# ScrollView

The ScrollView component is a React functional component written in TypeScript JSX. It takes in properties of type IScrollViewProps and renders a Box component from the Material-UI framework. The ScrollView accepts properties such as children, className, style, center (boolean), withScrollbar (boolean), hideOverflowX (boolean), and hideOverflowY (boolean). The component also accepts any other properties provided to the component.

The ScrollView is a wrapper around the Box component and includes additional properties like className, style, and otherProps. Inside the Box component is a div element that renders the children of ScrollView. The div element has its own classes and styles set based on the properties, offering a scrollable view area with optional scrollbars, overflows handling, and centering behavior. The actual look and behavior depend on what's inside useElement, useStyles, and the CSS classes defined in useStyles.

# SecretView

The `SecretView` is a React component that allows users to enter a code in a secure manner. It accepts various props such as `onCode`, which is a callback function that gets triggered when the code is entered, `enabled` to enable or disable the secret view, `title` and `description` to customize the display text, and `digits` to specify the number of digits in the code. The component uses a modal dialog to display the entered code, title, and description. It also has a close button that dismisses the component unless it is approved. The component listens to key press events and executes specific handlers based on the pressed key. The component's props follow an interface called `ISecretViewProps`, which includes optional properties for children components, CSS styling, and custom system styling from Material-UI. The `useActualState` and `useActualCallback` hooks are used to manage the component's state and callback functions, respectively.

# SizeProvider

The `SizeProvider` is a React component that measures and provides the size (width and height) of a target element to its child components. It accepts children, a className, a target HTML element and other props. The component observes the size of a target element, either provided as an HTML Element or the root of the `SizeProvider` component itself. It uses hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`, along with the ResizeObserver API to observe and update the size of the target element. The `SizeProvider` component wraps the children with a `SizeContextProvider` and `Box`, making the size information available to any child components through a context provider. This component is useful for situations where you need to know the dimensions of an element, particularly for responsive or adaptable layouts. Note that the Primitive ResizeObserver API is not supported in all browsers, and a polyfill might be needed for older browsers.

# SnackProvider

The `SnackProvider` is a React component that utilizes the Context API to provide snack notifications to its child components. It accepts props such as `children` and an optional `delay` for auto-hiding snacks. The component manages an array of `ISnack` objects called `alerts`, with functions to get the current alert, hide it, and add new alerts. It renders a `Snackbar` component when there's a current alert and wraps its child components in another `Provider` component, passing the `notify` function as a payload. The `Snackbar` is used to deliver non-critical messages or alerts, and it can be automatically dismissed after a specified duration.

# Spinner

The `Spinner` component is a React functional component written in TypeScript. It represents a loading animation, which is visually achieved through an SVG element with four rotating circles. The component takes an object as its argument, which is destructured into a `className` and an `otherProps` object. The `useStyles` and `useTheme` hooks are used to apply styles based on the application's theme. The `color` constant is set to the primary color of the theme in light mode, and white if not in light mode. The `Box` component wraps around the SVG, with classes combined using `classNames`. The SVG element contains four circle elements, which create the visual spinner animation. This `Spinner` component is typically used in applications to indicate a loading state during data fetching operations.

# Switch

The Switch component is a React TypeScript JSX code that serves as an essential part of Single Page Application (SPA) routing. It allows rendering different components based on the current location or route. The component takes in an object of props, including styling properties, component props for different states (load, error, forbidden, and not found), routing and animation properties, initialization and disposal callback functions, items representing routes, and a flag indicating whether to throw an error if an exception occurs.

The Switch component first sorts the routes (items) to prioritize those with fewer parameters and dynamic segments. It then handles initialization and disposal using React's useEffect hook, ensuring appropriate error handling. The component keeps track of the current location and responds to changes in the location.

The core logic, handleState, matches the current location against each route specified in items, checks any required access conditions for the route, and returns an object containing information on what to render based on the matched route. It handles various conditions such as redirection of a route.

Based on whether initialization is complete or not, the Switch component renders different views using FetchView. The code also takes care to memoize functions and values with the useMemo hook to avoid unnecessary re-computations.

This Switch component is a core part of an SPA router, enabling the app to navigate between different components or 'pages' without a page refresh.

# TabsView

The TabsView component is a reusable, high-level React component designed for creating tab-based navigation in a type-safe manner. It uses generics (Data and Payload) to allow for customization in different contexts. The component accepts various props for detailed customization and control over its behavior. It utilizes React's useState, useEffect, useMemo, and other hooks to manage state and optimize behaviors. Custom hooks, such as useElementSize for getting element sizes, useSingleton to create a singleton value, and useLocalHistory for managing local history states are also used. Memoized calculations for tabs and other properties ensure efficient re-runs when necessary. The tabs are dynamically generated based on the 'tabs' prop. The component uses hooks like useState, useEffect, and other React hooks to manage state, add listeners for history actions, calculate active steps and loading states, optimize rendering of loaders, and render the view using MUI's PaperView and Tabs components. The OutletView component is then rendered, filling the content for the selected tab.

# OutletView

The OutletView is a complex React component that serves as a view and supports traditional features such as loading state, validating state, change and submit event handlers, initial data property, class name, change subject, error-handling fallback, and more. It utilizes the history object for navigation between subviews.

Upon mounting, the component initializes its state using useState and useEffect hooks, which control various component properties like invalid, loading, pathname, data, and changed. The component also defines several methods for processing data, handling loading and submission events.

Custom hooks like useSingleton, useSubject, useActualValue, and useRenderWaiter are used within the component. These hooks' functionality is based on their respective definitions, which are not shown in this code fragment.

The main purpose of the OutletView is to handle and validate data changes while controlling rendering based on those changes and validation results. It incorporates synchronization with external systems (history object), data validation, and conditional rendering based on specific conditions. To fully understand the component, it's essential to review all related helper functions (like custom hooks) and types (such as IOutletViewProps, IAnything, IOtherProps, and other custom types).

# Tile

The Tile component is a highly customizable and efficient list viewer designed to handle various types of data. It uses generics to allow flexibility in the types of data it can display. The component is optimized for rendering large lists using virtual scrolling, which only renders the items currently in view and a buffer, leading to improved performance.

The Tile component is customizable through various props, including the rendering of each item, handling loading states and error messages, custom CSS styling, and interactions like skipping to the next page or handling click events. It also utilizes context providers like the SelectionProvider and RowMarkProvider for handling item selection and marking rows in the list.

The component optionally renders a "Show More" button if there's more data to load and no onSkip prop is provided. It also uses the VirtualView component for efficient rendering. The Tile component is reusable across different parts of the application, as seen in the GridView and CustomView components.

The useStyles hook is used for handling CSS-in-JS styles, while the useSingleton hook ensures there is only one instance of the provided payload object. The handleDataRequest function asynchronously handles the request for new data when more items need to be loaded into the list.

# TreeView

The TreeView component is a React functional component that creates an interactive tree view interface for displaying hierarchical data. It accepts several props such as className, style, sx, loading, items (the hierarchical data), value (selected values), and onChange (a callback function to handle changes). The component uses hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect and useMemo to manage its state, effects, and optimize calculations. It also utilizes the Autocomplete component from Material-UI for user interactions. The TreeView component has several custom hooks for managing changes, reload triggers and subject model. The component is highly customizable, leveraging advanced hooks and functionalities from React and Material-UI libraries, making it responsive and efficient.

# SearchView

The `SearchView` component is a custom, advanced search feature built with TypeScript for a React application. It is designed to handle various data types and payloads, thanks to its generic implementation. This component accepts a wide range of props, many with default values.

Internally, `SearchView` uses the `useState` hook to manage its state, which includes properties for search operations (`item`, `value`, and `open`) to manage the selected value and toggle the search dropdown. The component also utilizes several React hooks, such as `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` for performing side effects, memoizing values and callbacks, respectively.

To handle side effects within the component, `SearchView` uses custom hooks like `useSubject`, `useActualState`, `useActualValue`, `useActualCallback`, and `useQueuedAction`. These hooks likely assist in shaping async behavior, responding to changes, fetching data with pagination, and memoizing values and callbacks.

The `handler` function, passed to the `useOffsetPaginator` hook, is responsible for fetching data based on the search text, limit, and offset parameters. The `data` value is computed from the `rawData`, with duplicate values being filtered out using the `useMemo` hook.

The component uses the `useChange` hooks to perform side-effects when the search text or item changes in the state, and the `setOpen` function is a memoized callback that sets the `open` property of the state, potentially controlling the visibility of the dropdown.

# VirtualView

The VirtualView component is a TypeScript JSX implementation designed to efficiently render large data sets by loading only a limited number of rows at a time into the DOM. This component is ideal for handling potentially infinite data sets without overwhelming resources and provides a smoother user experience.

The component defines a set of properties with specified types to customize its behavior. It receives these properties as arguments along with some default values. React hooks such as useRef, useMemo, useState, useCallback, and useSingleton are used to manage state and other aspects of the component.

The handleDataRequest function triggers a data loading function and calls provided callback functions when data loading starts and ends, with error handling functionality included. The component also includes detailed calculations for measuring scroll position and heights to determine which data should be requested.

The getTopPos function calculates the offset of an element from the start of the virtual container by looping through children and adding their heights. The component uses a ResizeObserver to listen for resize events on specified elements and update state variables related to element size and positioning.

The logic in getStartIndex and getEndIndex calculates what data needs to be visible based on the current scroll position, making the component efficient in handling very large amounts of data. The component only renders what is necessary at any given point, instead of rendering the entire list of data at once, which can be a very resource-intensive process. This approach improves performance and user experience when dealing with big data sets.

# WaitView

The `WaitView` is a custom React component that allows you to control the rendering of other components based on a specific condition. It receives various props such as the `condition` function, components for loading (Loader), content state (Content), and error state (Error). The component uses React Hooks to manage its state, including whether initialization is complete (`initComplete`), the current attempt number (`attempt`), and a payload (`payload`). 

Once initialization is done, `WaitView` uses the Async component to execute the condition function and then, depending on the results (and the number of attempts), it will render the appropriate component (Loader, Content or Error) and invoke the `onDone` callback if the condition has been met. If initialization is not complete, `WaitView` renders nothing.

The `WaitView` component is flexible and can be used in various situations when you need to perform some asynchronous action before rendering a component, like data fetching, and you want to show different components for loading, success, and error states. It also provides default fallback functional components (React.Fragment) to ensure something is always rendered, preventing the component from failing during mounting.

# WizardView

The WizardView is a React functional component written in TypeScript that allows for customization through generic type arguments, Data and Payload. It accepts various props such as className, style, payload, outlinePaper, transparentPaper, history, pathname, steps, routes and more. The component utilizes multiple React hooks like useState, useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback along with custom hooks like useElementSize, useSingleton and useLocalHistory.

The component's state includes variables like path, loading, and progress. It renders a PaperView that displays steps using Stepper, shows a loading effect with LinearProgress bar, and includes an OutletView for the main content. The component uses makeStyles hook for styling with a theme. Overall, the WizardView is designed to manage and display a step-by-step process, handle the current step, maintain a loading state, and provide options for customization.
