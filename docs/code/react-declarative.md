# The `react-declarative.d.ts` module declaration

> Link [to the source code](../../demo/src/react-declarative.d.ts)

This TypeScript code is a module declaration for 'react-declarative'. It suggests that the codebase is using a custom library or framework called 'react-declarative' that might offer a set of utilities and components for building declarative React applications. The dependencies mentioned at the top of this file indicate which packages are being used within the 'react-declarative' module.

The `declare module 'react-declarative' {...}` block is used to define custom type definitions or augment existing definitions for the `react-declarative` module. TypeScript uses these definitions while static type-checking.

Inside this block, there are multiple import statements and export definitions. The imports are pulling in various types from the 'react-declarative' module, while the exports are exposing certain types, classes, and functions from the library for other modules to use.

Here are some of the key components and utilities this module declaration is defining:

1. **Model Part:** `TypedFieldInternal`, `IFieldInternal`, `IEntityInternal`, `IManagedInternal`, `IColumnInternal`, etc. These look like definitions related to a typical data model.

2. **List Part:** `useColumnConfig`, `IApiPaginatorParamsInternal`, `IArrayPaginatorParamsInternal`, etc. These are related to handling and configuring a List component.

3. **One Part:** `IOneApiHandlerParams`, which seems to be related to handling a single entity or 'one' component.

4. **Service and Route Management Part:** `createServiceManager`, `serviceManager`, `IServiceInternal`, `createRouteItemManager`, `createRouteParamsManager` etc. These are helpers for managing services and routing in the application.

5. **Utilities:** It also exports some utility hooks like `usePreventAutofill`, `useContextMenu`, `useRouteParams`, etc. for ease of development.
   
6. **Various hooks:** e.g., `useAsyncAction`, `useSingleton`, `useMediaContext`, `useWatchChanges`, `useForceUpdate`, etc. These can be used for various tasks such as handling state, managing asynchronous actions, control over rendering, and more.

This module declaration file is probably auto-generated via a tool like the 'dts-bundle' (as specified in the first comment line), which is used to bundle TypeScript declaration (.d.ts) files.
