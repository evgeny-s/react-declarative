# StateProvider

- A `StateProvider` component and a corresponding custom hook `useOneState` manages the form state. Let's break down the code: 

1. **`StateProvider` Component** :

- This component is a wrapper that manages the state of an object and provides it to its child components through a context. 
- It accepts various props to configure its behavior, such as `fields`, `features`, `change`, `fallback`, `handler`, `payload`, `loadStart`, and `loadEnd`. 

Inside the component: 

- It initializes state using the `useResolved` hook to resolve the object based on the provided `handler`.
- It manages the state of the object and checks for field invalidations. 
- It provides a context value containing the managed state to its children using `StateContext.Provider`. 
- It renders its children only if the object exists (`!!object`). 

2. **`useOneState` Hook** : 
- This hook is used to consume the state provided by the `StateProvider` component. 
- It retrieves the context value using `useContext(StateContext)` and casts it to `IState<Data>`.
- It returns the managed state object. 

3. **Types and Utilities** : 

- The code includes various types like `IStateProviderProps`, `IState<Data>`, and utility functions like `deepClone`. 
- It also defines a context called `StateContext`. 

4. **State Management Logic** :

- The `setObject` function updates the object state and checks for field invalidations. It merges the new data into the object using deep cloning. 
- The `changeObject` function is a wrapper around `setObject` that updates the state of the object using a deep clone operation. 

5. **Context Usage** : 

- The `StateProvider` component wraps its children with `StateContext.Provider`, providing the managed state to all descendant components that use `useOneState` hook.

6. **setObject Logic**

- The `wasInvalidRef.current` in the `setObject` function refers to a `ref` object that persists across re-renders of the component. It's typically used in React functional components to store mutable values that persist between renders.

In this specific code context:

```tsx
const wasInvalidRef = useRef(false);
```

`wasInvalidRef` is initialized as a ref holding a boolean value (`false`). This ref is used to keep track of whether any fields in the object were marked as invalid during state updates.

In the `setObject` function:

```tsx
const setObject = useCallback((data: Data, fieldInvalidMap: Record<string, boolean>) => {
    const { current: oneInvalidMap } = oneInvalidMapRef;
    const { current: object } = object$;
    setObjectHook(data);
    Object.entries(fieldInvalidMap).forEach(([key, value]) => {
        oneInvalidMap[key] = value;
    });
    if (!Object.values(oneInvalidMap).some((isTrue) => isTrue)) {
        if (data !== object || wasInvalidRef.current) {
            wasInvalidRef.current = false;
            change!(data, false);
        }
    } else {
        wasInvalidRef.current = true;
    }
}, []);
```
 
- `wasInvalidRef.current` is used to track whether any fields were previously marked as invalid. If any fields were previously marked as invalid (`wasInvalidRef.current` is `true`), it means that the object was considered invalid before the current update. 
- If the current update does not result in any fields being marked as invalid (`!Object.values(oneInvalidMap).some((isTrue) => isTrue)`), and either the data has changed or the object was previously marked as invalid (`wasInvalidRef.current`), it calls the `change` function (if provided) to notify of the change in the object's validity.

So, `wasInvalidRef.current` serves as a flag to keep track of whether the object was previously marked as invalid and needs to notify any changes in its validity.

In summary, this StateProvider implements a pattern for managing and providing state to components within a React application using context and custom hooks. It encapsulates state logic and provides an interface for accessing and updating that state throughout the application.
