# Hooks

> Hooks build into `react-declarative`

## useActualCallback

This hook is used to execute a callback function while preserving its reference and memoizing it with specified dependencies. Memoization is a form of optimization where you save expensive computations and re-use them when needed, rather than calculating again. 

This useCallback is similar to the built-in `useCallback` hook from React, but with an additional benefit. This custom hook also stores the latest version of the callback function using the `useRef` hook, ensuring that you have always access to the latest state inside the callback, even if it has not been declared within the functionâ€™s dependency array.

Here are detailed explanations about the code:

- `export const useActualCallback = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(run: T, deps: any[] = []): T => { ... }`

  This is the declaration of the `useActualCallback` hook. It is a generic function that accepts one or two arguments. The first argument `'run'` is a callback function and `'deps'` is an array of dependencies that if changed, will cause the callback function reference to be re-created. If no dependencies are provided, an empty array `[]` is used (meaning the callback will always have the same reference). Function returns the memoized callback function of type `'T'`.

- `const executeRef = useRef<T>(run);`

  The `useRef` hook is used here to hold the value of the callback function. It creates a mutable ref object where `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`run`), returned as a persisting object `{current: run}`.

- `executeRef.current = run;`

  The latest version of the `run` callback function is assigned to the `executeRef.current`. 

- `return useCallback(((...args: any[]) => executeRef.current(...args)) as T, deps);`

  The `useCallback` hook will return a memoized version of the `executeRef.current` callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for passing callbacks down to optimized child components that depend on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

Note: The `useCallback` hook is used to enhance performance in React applications.
  
Regarding the 'do not mention code from attachments unless it's needed', as the question specifically asked for explaining a bit of TypeScript code, it was indeed necessary to discuss it.

```typescript
import { useRef, useCallback } from "react";
```
This code is importing `useRef` and `useCallback` hooks from `react`. Both hooks are required by `useActualCallback` for memoizing a callback.

## useActualRef

a custom React hook named `useActualRef` that creates and manages a mutable reference to a state value.

There are five key elements to this code:

**1. Initial Declaration**
The hook is declared as a generic function with the initial state that can either be a value of any type (`S`) or a function that returns a value of type `S`. The type (`S`) is specified using generics (`<S>`).

```typescript
export const useActualRef = <S = undefined>(initialState?: S | (() => S)) => {
  ...
};
```

**2. Default Value Configuration**
A hook named `useSingleton` is used to get the default value. The hook 'useSingleton' is not defined in the provided code block, but we can assume that it generates a singleton value from the initial state.

```typescript
const defaultValue = useSingleton(initialState);
```

**3. Reference Creation**
Next, `useRef` hook is called to create a mutable ref object where `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`defaultValue`). `useRef` is a built-in React hook that allows us to create a ref to a value that persists across renders, and does not cause render when updated.

```typescript
const stateRef = useRef<S>(defaultValue!);
```

**4. Handler Function Creation**
The `useCallback` hook is used to create a new state update function called `handleState` which accepts either a new state value or a function that calculates new state based on the previous state. This function will update the reference (`stateRef`) with the new state value. `useCallback` is another built-in React hook that returns a memoized version of the callback function.

```typescript
const handleState = useCallback((dispatch: S | ((prevState: S) => S)) => {
  ...
  stateRef.current = newState;
  ...
}, []);
```

**5. Hook Return Value**
Finally, this hook returns an array with two items - the state reference and `handleState` function, which are marked as read-only array using `as const`.

```typescript
return [stateRef, handleState] as const;
```

In general, this hook allows you to use the React's state functionality with mutable reference which is different from the useState hook that triggers re-renders when the state is updated. Instead of triggering a re-render, it allows the current state value to be accessed and updated anytime without causing render, which can be useful in many scenarios where re-rendering is unwanted or expensive.

## useActualState

a custom React Hook named `useActualState`.

The `useActualState` hook is a generics function, whose generics `S` is the type of the state. It takes an optional parameter `initialState` which can be an `S` type value or a function that returns an `S` type value as the initial state.

```typescript
export const useActualState = <S = undefined>(initialState?: S | (() => S))
```

In the body of the function, `useState<S>` is used to create a state and its updater function (`state` and `setState`). `initialState` is used as the initial value of the state. For this, the initialState is force unwrapped using `!` operator.

```typescript
const [state, setState] = useState<S>(initialState!)
```

A mutable ref object is created using `useRef` and the initial value for this ref is `state`.

```typescript
const stateRef = useRef(state);
```

A function `handleState` is created by means of `useCallback`, which updates the state and ref both. This function accepts either a directly new state value or a function that can generate a new state based on the current state. The provided function (must return a new state value) or directly provided new state value is used to assign `newState`.

Inside `handleState`, the current ref's value and the state are updated with `newState`.

```typescript
const handleState: typeof setState = useCallback((dispatch) => {
    let newState: S;
    if (typeof dispatch === 'function') {
        newState = (dispatch as Function)(stateRef.current);
    } else {
        newState = dispatch;
    }
    stateRef.current = newState;
    setState(newState);
}, []);
```

Finally, the function returns a tuple with `stateRef` and `handleState` as a constant tuple.

```typescript
return  [
    stateRef,
    handleState,
] as const;
```

The effect of this `useActualState` hook is that you will have a state and a state updater that will always have the newest state inside the callback, because the ref is updated every time when the state is changed. The returned mutable ref object `stateRef` always represents the current state which can be used directly for state reading, while `handleState` is used for state updating.

## useActualValue

a custom hook named "useActualValue".

```typescript
export const useActualValue = <T = undefined>(value: T) => {
  const valueRef = useRef<T>(value)
  valueRef.current = value
  return valueRef
}
```

In React, a hook is a function provided by the library which lets you manage and use state and other lifecycle methods1 without writing a class component. In other words, it is a reusable functionality that you can use in functional components.

This specific hook "useActualValue" accepts a value as an argument and creates a ref object initialized with that value via React's built-in useRef hook. It then updates the current property of the said ref object with the given value. 

In JavaScript, a ref is a way to access and interact with DOM nodes or React elements. It can hold a mutable value similar to how state properties update. However, updating a ref does not cause a re-render, unlike state updates. 

Here, `useRef<T>(value)` is used to create a new React ref where `T` is the type parameter indicating the type of value the ref will hold. It's initialized to `undefined` but it could be set to any JavaScript type (such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, an object type, etc...). `valueRef.current = value` is updating the current value that the ref is pointing to.

This hook can be useful when you need to keep track of a value, and this value can change over time(for example in an animation or an event), but you do not want to cause a re-render every time the value changes.

The JSDoc comments above the function explain its function and expected parameters further.

## useAlert

a React hook called "useAlert" which can be used to manage an alert modal's display and functionality in a React application. The alert modal's information such as title, description etc. is managed by this hook.

Here is an expanded explanation of its functionality:

- `useAlert` exports a function that accepts an optional parameter of type `IParams`. The `IParams` interface defines `title`, `description`, and `large` properties. The `title` and `description` are strings that are used to set an alert's description and title. The `large` boolean property specifies whether to display a large alert or not.

- The `useAlert` hook uses `useRef` to create a reference called `changeRef` to a function (`Fn`) that can be changed dynamically.

- It defines a function `getInitialState` using `useActualCallback` which returns an `IState` that has the default or inputted `title`, `description`, and `open` status (which is initially set to `false`).

- The hook uses `useEffect` to update the `title` and `description` whenever they change and the alert is not currently open.

- It defines a function `handleChange` which invokes the function given to `changeRef`, resets the state to initial, and hides the alert modal.

- The hook also uses the `useModal` function to control the display of the modal alert. This custom hook uses a `showModal` and `hideModal` function to control the visibility of the alert.

- `useAlert` finally returns a function that opens the modal and sets its content to the input parameters (`title` and `description`). This function, when invoked, returns an instance of an anonymous class that offers two methods to the caller:
  
  1. A `then` method that accepts a callback function and assigns it to `changeRef.current`, which is executed when the alert modal is closed.
     
  2. A `toPromise` method that returns a Promise which is resolved when the alert modal is closed.

This would be used in a React component to open and manage an Alert modal dynamically within an application. It provides a lot of flexibility, for example, you can create an alert with just a description by calling the function returned by `useAlert` without a `title` parameter, like this: `useAlert()({ description: 'This is a sample alert!' })`. The created alert will use the default title ("Alert") and the provided description. When the alert is closed, the returned Promise will be resolved.

## useAsyncAction

A hook for React called `useAsyncAction`. It's a custom hook that handles running and managing the lifecycle of an asynchronous action.

The `useAsyncAction` function receives two parameters. The first one `run`, is a function that receives a Payload type and it returns either an object of type Data or a Promise that will resolve to an object of type Data. The second parameter `options`, is an object of type `IParams` that defines four optional properties: `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `fallback`, and `throwError`.

The function declares several local state variables using `useRef` and `useState` and returns an object containing those public states that are associated with asynchronous operation:

- `loading`: A boolean flag indicating whether the `run` function is ongoing.
- `error`: A boolean flag indicating whether the `run` function has encountered an error.
- `execute`: A function that triggers the `run` function with a given payload. This function includes lifecycle management; it sets `loading` true at start, attempts to run the `run` function, sets `error` on catch block if an error is thrown, and sets `loading` false at finally block. This function is enclosed with `useCallback`, optimizing re-rendering performance.

Some of the important subroutines used in the code include:

- The `cancelable` function: This allows creating cancelable async functions. It's used to make the `run` function cancelable, and it returns a version of the function that has a `.cancel()` method.

- The `useActualCallback` hook: This ensures that React's `useCallback` dependency array will contain actual values, not mere state setters or other functions.

- The react `useState` hook: Manages local component state.

- The react `useRef` hook: Stores a mutable "box" that can hold any value type. Often used to hold references to html elements or to store mutable state that doesn't trigger re-render when modified. 

- The react `useCallback` hook: Returns a memoized version of a function. This is useful for passing stable props to React components or memoizing event handlers across renders. 

- The react `useLayoutEffect` hook: This is identical to the `useEffect` hook but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations, ensuring that changes to layout get rendered synchronously before the browser gets a chance to paint. This is used to safely manage the unmounting state of a React component using an isMounted flag.

Please note that this TypeScript code is used in a React project, hence the usage of hooks and references to lifecycle events, which are concepts from the React library. All the Typescript generics and interfaces are used to provide strong type safety checks for this custom React Hook function.

Let me know if you need in-depth explanation of a specific part of the code, or if you have other questions!

## useAsyncProgress

This hook is designed to facilitate the tracking of asynchronous processes that return a particular result, handle any potential errors, and provide progress updates.

Here is a summary of the key aspects of the `useAsyncProgress` function:

1. **Generic Parameters**
   The function accepts two generic types:

    - `Data`: The type of data to be processed. It defaults to `IAnything`, an imported interface.
    - `Result`: The expected result from the processing function.

2. **Parameters**
   The function requires two parameters:

    - `process`: A function that takes an item of the `IProcess` data type and returns either an instance of `Result` or a Promise resolving to `Result`.
    - `options`: An object of optional parameters, which can include `delay`, `onError`, `onProgress`, `onFinish`, `onBegin`, `onEnd`, and other parameters. All of these parameters are callback functions that run under certain conditions during the process.

3. **Custom Hooks and State Management**
   Several custom hooks are used, such as `useActualState` and `useActualCallback`, that seem to manage state and memoized callbacks. Specifics would need more context, but the broad-strokes purpose is to handle stateful values and callback function instances through the life of this component (or wherever it's being utilized).

4. **Process Execution**
   The main functionality of this function comes from defining an `execute` function, which applies a processing function to each item (with the aid of a helper function `useSinglerunAction`). This function deals with each item individually, waits for the delay, and then processes the item, catching and handling any errors that arise.

Let's illustrate its usage in a potential use case: tracking an upload process. Let's say you're uploading several files to a server. `Data` could represent the file data, and `Result` could represent the upload response. You could then pass an `uploadFile` function as `process` and define `onProgress`, `onError`, `onFinish` functions to update your UI accordingly.

Overall, this function provides a versatile way to handle data processing in an asynchronous manner with robust error handling and progress tracking capabilities.

## useAsyncValue

a hook `useAsyncValue` that is used to handle asynchronous values. This hook could be useful in scenarios where you have some value that is obtained asynchronously, such as data fetched from an API. This hook manages the state (value, error, loading) related to such asynchronous data handling.

Here is a detailed walkthrough of the code snippet:

```typescript
export const useAsyncValue = <Data extends any = any>(
  run: () => Data | Promise<Data>,
  params: IParams = {}
): [Data | null, IResult<void, void>, (data: Data) => void] => { 

  const [result, setResult] = useState<Data | null>(null); 
```
This function is a generic function that can work with any data type. It takes two parameters:

- a `run` function: This function when run, must return a value of type `Data` or a Promise that resolves to a value of type `Data`. Basically, `run` is an asynchronous function that fetches/produces some data.
- `params`: This is an object of `IParams` type which contains optional parameters for customizing the behavior of the async value.

The hook initializes a state variable `result` to null. This is a React state variable which will eventually hold the result coming from the `run` function.

```typescript
const action = useAsyncAction(async () => {
    const result = await run();
    setResult(result);
  }, params);
```
Next `useAsyncValue` sets up an asynchronous action by invoking `useAsyncAction`. It passes an async function to `useAsyncAction` which fetches data by running the `run` function and then saves it into the `result` state variable with `setResult`. The `params` are passed as second arguments to `useAsyncAction`.

```typescript
const { deps = [] } = params;
  useEffect(() => {
    action.execute();
  }, deps);
  return [result, action, setResult];
};
```
At the end, the hook uses the `useEffect` to ensure that the `action.execute()` call is performed whenever the dependencies (`deps`) change. If `deps` is not provided in the `params`, an empty array is used as the `useEffect` dependency, which means `action.execute()` is executed only on the first (mounting) render of the component.

Finally, the hook returns an array with the following three values:
- `result`: The current state of the async value.
- `action`: An object containing information about the execution of the async action.
- `setResult`: A setter function for updating the async value.

The `useAsyncValue` hook essentially simplifies the process of setting up, executing, and handling the results (or potential errors) of asynchronous operations, and especially useful while dealing with fetch requests in React functional components.

## useAudioPlayer

a custom React hook named `useAudioPlayer`. This hook creates an audio player with control functions. Here's how it works:

To understand this, let's break down each step:

1. It takes an object as a parameter, which is defined by the interface `IParams`. This object should have a property `src`, which should be a `string`, representing the URL of the audio file to be played.

2. It defines a `useRef` hook named `audioRef` to keep track of the audio element. The `HTMLAudioElement` generic argument tells TypeScript what type of elements will be placed in this ref.

3. Then it sets up a `useState` hook named `isPlaying`, to keep track of whether or not the audio file is currently playing.

4. The `useReloadTrigger` imported from `./useReloadTrigger` seems to return an object with `doReload` function and `reloadTrigger` value, both of which are used to trigger changes in the audio component.

5. Two functions `handleStart` and `handleEnd` are defined to handle the starting and ending of the play event.

6. A function `render` is defined to generate the audio component, which is only added to the JSX if `isPlaying` is true.

The hook returns an object with three values `audioRef`, `render` and `play`. `audioRef` is the ref to the audio element, `render` is the JSX rendering function, and `play` is the function to start audio playing.

This function can be used in a component to create an interactive audio player for a specified source URL. This is useful for managing and controlling audio playback in a React application.

Here's an example of using it in a component:

```typescript jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
    const { render, play } = useAudioPlayer({ src: 'http://example.com/audio.mp3' });

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={play}>Play</button>
            {render()}
        </div>
    );
};
```

## useBehaviorSubject

The hook `useBehaviorSubject` is a generic function that can be parameterized with a type `Data`. It accepts one argument `data` which can be of type `Data` or `null`. If no argument is provided, it defaults to `null`.

This hook uses another custom Hook - `useSingleton` and wraps a BehaviorSubject instance initialization in it. Essentially, it initializes a singleton BehaviorSubject object with the provided initial data value.

#### Let' break down the parts:

  * `Data = any` - This is a generic type parameter which defaults to `any`. By using a generic parameter this function can be used with any type of data.

  * `data: Data | null = null` - This is an argument that defaults to `null`. It's expected to be the initial value of the BehaviorSubject.

  * `useSingleton(() => new BehaviorSubject<Data>(data))` - it calls `useSingleton` hook with the initialization function of a BehaviorSubject instance as an argument. Singleton means that this instance will be created once and only once, and the same instance will be returned on subsequent calls, as long as we are in the same component instance.

#### What is BehaviorSubject?

`BehaviorSubject` is part of [RxJS library](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject) usually, a powerful library for reactive programming. BehaviorSubject is a type of subject, a subject is a special type of observable so you can subscribe to messages like any other observable. The unique features of BehaviorSubject are:

- It needs an initial value as it must always return a value on subscription even if it hasn't received a `next()`.
- Upon subscription, it returns the last value of the subject. A regular observable only triggers when it receives an `onNext`.
- At any point, you can retrieve the last value of the subject in a non-observable code using the `getValue()` method.

Unique features of `useSingleton`:

- `useSingleton` is a hook that ensures the creation of a single instance of something (in this case BehaviorSubject) within the lifecycle of the component where the hook is used.

So this custom hook `useBehaviorSubject`, when used in a React component, will give you a reference to a singleton BehaviorSubject, and allows you to keep track of a piece of data that can be provided with the initial value, observed for changes, and for which you can get the current value at any point.

## useChange

a custom React hook named `useChange` exported from a module.

This hook is designed to execute a given effect (which is a function) in response to changes in a dependencies list, similar to the built-in `useEffect` hook from React. However, `useChange` provides additional features such as the ability to stop or start watching changes, and resetting the watcher which is the entity that triggers the effect when a dependency changes.

The `useChange` hook takes three parameters:

- `effect`: This is a callback function that should be executed when the dependencies change.
- `deps`: This is an optional list of dependencies to watch for changes. The `effect` is only executed when one of these dependencies changes. If no dependencies are specified, an empty array is used as a default value, therefore no execution triggers are set.
- `stopWatchByDefault`: This is an optional boolean indicating whether the hook should initially stop watching for changes.

**Details of the Hook**

The hook uses the `useRef` hook to create mutable ref objects `initialChange` and `stopWatch` that hold the state of the watcher.

- `initialChange.current` is initially set to `true`.
- `stopWatch.current` is initially set to the value of `stopWatchByDefault`.

Use of `initialChange` enables executing the effect only when dependencies have actually changed and not on initial render, because `useEffect` runs also on the initial render.

The `useEffect` hook is used to set up the watcher which runs the `effect` callback upon a change in the dependencies contained in the `deps` list, except when `initialChange.current` or `stopWatch.current` is `true`.

Inside `useEffect`, `Destructor` is returned by default when `initialChange.current` or `stopWatch.current` is `true`. `Destructor` is a function that does nothing and presumably is used as a cleanup function for this effect which `useEffect` will call when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change. However, since `Destructor` is empty, there are no cleanup actions performed before re-running the effect or unmounting the component.

The hook returns an object of utility functions (enclosed in the `useMemo` hook) allowing to manipulate the watcher from a React component:

- `resetWatcher`: Resets the watcher so that the `effect` will not be executed until the dependencies change again.
- `beginWatch`: Starts watching the dependencies and executes the `effect` when they change.
- `stopWatch`: Stops the watcher from reacting to dependency changes.

The `useMemo` hook is used here to cache the utility functions object and return the same object on every render, unless one of the dependencies (`[]` in this case, none) changes. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when using these methods in a component.

## useChangeSubject

A hook called `useChangeSubject`. It's a [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that creates a reactive subject using an initial value and a particular type (`T`). Reactive programming paradigms are often used in frontend JavaScript frameworks for managing state and handling updates throughout an application's components in a predictable manner. In this case, the reactive subject (created using `new Subject<T>()`) is used to emit a change every time the given value is updated.

Let's walk through it:

```typescript
export const useChangeSubject = <T = undefined>(value: T) => {
  const subject = useSingleton(() => new Subject<T>());
  useChange(() => void subject.next(value), [value]);
  return subject;
};
```

- This function takes `value` as a parameter, which may be of different types (`T`). 

- `useSingleton(() => new Subject<T>())` is a Hook that ensures a single instance of `Subject<T>`. `Subject` is a class which manages and contains various methods related to behavior of the Observer pattern within this codebase (as you can see from the relevant methods you shared earlier).

- `useChange(() => void subject.next(value), [value]);` is another Hook that looks like it would trigger a side-effect (specified by the first argument: `() => void subject.next(value)`) whenever the `value` (specified in its dependency array: `[value]`) changes. This change is then passed to every observer of this subject using `subject.next(value)` method. 

- The function finally returns the `subject` instance. 

Together, the function `useChangeSubject` creates a kind of "watcher" which observes changes to `value`, and when `value` changes, it triggers the reactive sequence in `subject` to alert any observers/listeners about this change.

Some parts of the `Subject` class and its related modules/classes you provided are not directly related to explaining the `useChangeSubject` function itself and hence not included in this explanation. Having said that, these parts are likely critical in understanding the overall context of how observables, observers and subjects are used in the broader codebase. 

This is a common pattern especially in projects built with RxJS (Reactive Extension for JavaScript), where `Subject`, `Observer`, `Observable` are core concepts. This codebase seems to implement a variation or subset of those concepts for its own specific needs.

## useCollection

A custom React Hook, `useCollection`, which returns an instance of a `CollectionAdapter` that can be used to manage a collection of `IEntity` objects. 

Here is a short line-by-line explanation:

1. `useCollection` is made a generic function by using `<T extends IEntity = any>`, where T is any type that extends `IEntity`. `IEntity` is an interface with an 'id' field of type string or number.

2. The hook accepts an `IParams<T>` object as parameters, with default values set for `initialValue`, `onChange` and `debounce`.

3. `useRef` is used to create mutable references `collection$` and `dispose$` which will persist the same values across re-renders. `collection$` will hold our `Collection<T>` instance while `dispose$` holds a `BehaviorSubject<true>` instance (from the RxJS library).

4. `handlePrevData` is a callback that returns the items in `collection$`. It is created using `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

5. `useState` is used to instantiate a new `Collection<T>` object with `initialValue`, `debounce` and `handlePrevData` arguments. `collection$.current` is then set to this new Collection.

6. `useActualCallback` is used on `onChange` to get the actual callback function. 

7. `useEffect` is used to attach a change handler to the Collection. If `dispose$.data` is false, a new `Collection<T>` is created and set as the current collection and also as the state. It also calls `handleChange` with `CollectionAdapter` and optionally with `CollectionEntityAdapter`. This effect depends on `collection`.

8. Another `useEffect` is used in a way that its cleanup function will be invoked when the component unmounts. It invokes the `handleDropChanges` function on the collection and also calls the `next()` function on `dispose$`. This effect has no dependencies and so will only run once.

9. `useMemo` is finally used to return a new `CollectionAdapter<T>` object. This makes sure a new object is only created when `collection` changes, not during every render.

This custom hook seems to be part of a larger application usually involving a Model-view-viewmodel-like (MVVM) pattern, making use of RxJS and custom Collection and Entity classes to manage state and bind it to the view. This hook specifically is used to manage a collection of instances of a specific `Entity` type. 

This hook might be used, for instance, in a list component where `IEntity` could be a task or a note, facilitating operations like maintaining, creating, and deleting tasks/notes. 

Note: Some components and functions like `Collection`, `CollectionAdapter`, `CollectionEntityAdapter`, `useSingleton` and `useActualCallback` come from your project or libraries and are not a part of TypeScript or React. These would have been defined elsewhere in the project. So, their implementation details are hidden in this context.

## useCollectionBinding

a custom React hook `useCollectionBinding` used to bind a collection of entities to a component and provides callbacks for updating this collection. 

Here are the main parts of this function:

- It accepts a parameter of type `IParams` (templated by T, which extends IEntity). This type `IParams` includes the following members:
  - `creator`: A function that receives the collection, a change subject and a begin function, and should return either a void value or a cleanup function.
  - `onChange`: Optional callback function that receives the collection adapter, the entity adapter of the changed entity and a boolean defining whether the change detected is the initial seeding of the collection.
  - `initialValue`: Optional initial value for the collection.
  - `debounce`: Optional debounce time for onChange callback (in milliseconds).

This function returns the collection of entities or `null` if it's still loading.

The main logic breakdown is as follows:

1. `useState` and `useRef` hooks are used to handle the loading state and to track if the initialization has been completed.

2. A `handleChange` function is defined. It's used as the callback for the `onChange` behavior.

3. It uses the custom hook `useCollection` to maintain the collection of items.

4. It uses `useChangeSubject` and `useSingleton` for managing changes in the collection.

5. In a `useEffect` hook, it subscribes to the `emit` object and checks the `loading` and `initComplete` states before calling `change.next(model)` function.

6. It calls the `useChange` hook to update the `initComplete.current` state based on the `loading` state.

7. It calls another `useEffect` hook to call the `creator` function and manage the cleanup if any.

8. Finally, it checks the `loading` state, and returns `null` if loading is true or the collection if loading is false.

The dependencies for this code appear to come from the same project and consist of other custom hooks and helper classes: `useCollection`, `useChangeSubject`, `useSingleton`, `Subject`, and `useChange`. All of these probably offer some post-creation, pre-render behavior handling for the collection.

## useConfirm

a custom Hook named `useConfirm` that is designed to provide functionality for generating and managing a confirmation dialog.

Here's an explanation of different parts:

#### Parameters:

The parameters passed to the hook are an object `IParams` type which may include the `title`, `msg` and `canCancel`:

- `title`: The title to be displayed on the dialog.
- `msg`: The message to be displayed in the dialog.
- `canCancel`: A boolean value to determine if the dialog can be cancelled.

These parameters have default values set to: `defaultTitle = ""`, `defaultMsg = ""`, and `defaultCanCancel = true`.

### State Management:

The state of the dialog is tracked with the `useActualRef` Hook which returns `[state$, setState]` where:

- `state$`: A reference to the current state.
- `useState`: A function that is used to set the current state.

The state object `IState` comprises of:

- `currentTitle`: The current title of the dialog.
- `currentMsg`: The current message of the dialog.
- `currentCanCancel`: The current cancelability of the dialog.
- `open`: A boolean indicating if the dialog is open or not.

### Effect Hooks:

There are three `useEffect` Hooks that update the title, message, and 'cancelability' of the dialog when they're not open, and their corresponding default value changes.

### Change Handling:

The `handleChange` function changes the state and hides modal. It is executed every time a change takes place in the state of the dialog.

### Showing/Hiding the Dialog:

The `useModal` Hook is used for managing the visibility of the dialog. The `showModal` and `hideModal` functions returned allow for showing the dialog and hiding it respectively.

### Return:

The `useConfirm` hook returns a function that can display the dialog with optional parameters for title, message, and cancelability. This returned function, when invoked, sets the state and shows the dialog. In addition, the returned function has a `then` method to handle the outcome of the dialog and `toPromise` method that converts the asynchronous operation into a Promise.

Here's a TypeScript JSX code snippet that shows the return type:

```typescript jsx
return ({ canCancel, title, msg }: Partial<IParams> = {}) =>
    new (class {
      //...
    })();
```

Overall, this code snippet is a good illustration of how to use a combination of Hooks, JSX, and async functionality in a TypeScript context to manage a UI feature such as a dialog box.

## useContextMenu

useContextMenu hook is a named generic function. This function accepts an object `params` of type `IParams<T>`, returns an object of type `IResult` and uses React component development methodologies such as hooks.

This function is using for generating and controlling a context menu with certain configurable options. You can specify menu items, handle click events, predefine the condition for executing click event, custom loading logic, and rendering arbitrary components before/after the menu items. For avoiding unnecessary renders, it uses some custom hooks such as `useActualCallback`, `useActualValue`.

Let's break down the code:

The function takes as argument an object `params` of type `IParams<T>` and destructures it into multiple properties.

The object `params` has various properties:

- `keepMounted`: It is a boolean indicating if the menu should stay mounted even if it's closed.
- `BeforeContent` and `AfterContent`: These are optional React components which will be rendered before and after the menu items, respectively.
- `deps`: Dependencies to trigger reload of menu items.
- `payload`: The payload object passed to menu item handlers.
- `onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd`: Callback function invoked when the menu items start/finish loading.
- `onAction`: Callback function invoked when a menu item is clicked. It gets an action string as argument.
- `options`: Array of options to render as menu items.
- `fallback`: The component to render as a fallback during loading.
- `reloadSubject`: The subject to trigger a reload of menu items.
- `throwError`: Flag indicating if an error should be thrown on loading failures.

The function returns an object with two properties:

- `elementProps`: an object with properties `onContextMenu` to handle the context menu.
- `render`: a function to render the desired JSX for the context menu.

Unto the returned object:
- The `elementProps` property contains logic for deciding the behavior of the context menu: it will appear when the user right-clicks on the component that uses these props.
- The `render` property, a function which returns a component (specifically, a Menu component). This menu will have menu items (`MenuItem` components) created based on the prop `options`. Moreover, it will display a loader (`CircularProgress`) if menu items are loading.

With `onContextMenu` function in `elementProps`, you can specify the location of the context menu to a certain extension. The behavior of the click event and the location of the context menu depends on the `options` length.

Meanwhile, the `handleClick` function is used in the menu items to handle the click event on those items.

This is a nutshell of what the explained code does with context menu in a React and Typescript project.

The `useStyles` is creating CSS classes for styling the context menu and its items. It employs Material-UI's approach of CSS-in-JS.

Also, this function uses some external custom hooks and functions like `useActualCallback`, `useAsyncAction` and `useState`. The code for these is not provided.

Please note that this explanation assumes a familiarity with React and Material UI concepts.

## useDate

a custom hook `useDate`. 

The `useDate` return function, when invoked, returns an instance of a class that provides a `Promise`-based interface to interact with a date picker component.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening in this hook:

- The `useDate` function uses the `useRef` hook to create a `changeRef` that will hold a function of the type `Fn`. `Fn` type is a function accepting one argument that can be `dayjs.Dayjs` (which is provided by the dayjs library for manipulating dates) or `null`. 

- A function `handleChange` is also defined, which is intended to be a callback for the DatePicker's `onChange` event. When the DatePicker's current selected date changes, this function is called with the new date. If a function has been saved in `changeRef`, it gets called with the new date. Following this, the `hideModal` function is called to hide the modal window.

- The `useModal` hook is then invoked, passing in a function that renders a `DatePicker` component with the `handleChange` function attached to the `onChange` event. `useModal` provides two functions: `showModal` and `hideModal`, used to display and hide the modal window containing the date picker.

- An anonymous class is returned which, when instantiated, immediately calls `showModal`. The class has two methods: `then` and `toPromise`. The `then` method simply sets `changeRef` to the passed function while the `toPromise` method returns a promise that resolves to the selected date.

The code uses advanced TypeScript features, like generics and type inference, alongside the React library to provide a neat, promise-based interface for reacting to user's selecting a date from a date picker. This approach is beneficial because it abstracts away the complexity of managing the date picker modal's state and gives a simple interface to just deal with the picked date.

## useElementSize

a custom React hook named `useElementSize`. This hook is a function that is meant to be used inside a React component to calculate the size of an HTML element and update it when it changes.

Here is the explanation of the `useElementSize` hook:

- This hook is generic over two types: `T` which must extend `HTMLElement`, and `Size` which must extend the `ISize` interface. By using generics, this hook can work with different specific types of HTML elements and size interfaces, offering greater flexibility.

- The function expects an argument `options` which is a partial object based on the interface `IParams<Size>`. This means all properties on the `IParams<Size>` object are optional when calling `useElementSize`. The default value for this argument is an empty object.

- The role of each property in the `IParams<Size>` options object is as follows:

  - `defaultSize`: Sets the default dimensions (height and width) of the HTML element when it is not provided.
  - `target`: Specifies the HTML element for which the size should be computed. If not provided, the component's own element is used.
  - `closest`: Specifies a selector for selecting an ancestor element of the target element.
  - `selector`: Specifies a selector for selecting a specific descendant of the target element.
  - `debounce`: Specifier the debounce delay in milliseconds for resizing events.
  - `compute`: A function used to compute the size object based on the raw size. The default is a type-cast to `Size`.
  - `onResize`: A callback function invoked every time the target element's size changes. 

- `useElementSize` hook initializes several pieces of React local state and refs:

  - `elementRef` uses the `useRef` hook of React to initialize a mutable ref object, that will be connected to the `HTMLElement`. 
  - `isMounted` another `useRef` hook is used to track the mounted state of the component using the hook.
  - `height` and `width` are state values initialized via the `useState` hook from the `defaultSize` provided in the options, defaulting to `0` if not provided.
  - `useActualValue(size)` This custom hook is also invoked which presumably provides the actual size of the element.
 
- A `useLayoutEffect` is used, internally creating a `debounce` function which is a higher-order function that delays the processing of the function given to it as an argument, reducing how often it's invoked. This debounce function calculates the size of the target element and compares it to the existing size. If the size has changed it sets the new size and calls the `onResize` callback if provided. 

- Next, it creates an instance of the `ResizeObserver` class. The `ResizeObserver` is a browser API that observes changes to an element's dimensions and calls the provided callback whenever these dimensions change. It uses the size computation and debounced function defined earlier to handle changes to the target element's size.

- Finally, it returns an object containing a `ref` to the HTML element and the current size of the element. This allows the calling component to attach the `ref` to an element and get its current size.

In summary, `useElementSize` offers a React hook for conveniently working with the size of HTML elements, offering functionality such as dimension observing and resizing debouncing.

This hook could be used like so:

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
    const { elementRef, size } = useElementSize<HTMLElement, ISize>({
        defaultSize: {
            height: 1920,
            width: 1080,
        },
        debounce: 100,
    });

    return <div ref={elementRef}>My element is {size.width}px wide and {size.height}px tall</div>;
};
```

## useEntity

a custom React Hook that manages an "entity" state. An "entity" is defined as an object with some properties (including an `id`). The state of this entity object can be managed, including its creation, reading, updating and debouncing its updates. The concept is similar to the way you would use `useState` for state management in React.

See a breakdown of the hook below:

- `export const useEntity = <T extends IEntity = any>({ initialValue, onChange = () => null, debounce = CHANGE_DEBOUNCE, }: IParams<T>) => {...}`: this is the declaration of the `useEntity` hook, which takes an object of type `IParams` as a parameter. This object includes `initialValue` (which is the initial state of the entity), `onChange` (a callback function that executes when the entity state changes), and `debounce` (the delay in milliseconds before changes to entity state take effect).


- `const entity$ = useRef<Entity<T>>(null as never);`: the `useRef` hook is used here with type parameter `Entity<T>`. This reference (`entity$`) is initialized with `null` and is used as a mutable container to hold the current entity.


- `const [entity, setEntity] = useState(() => new Entity(initialValue, debounce, handlePrevData));`: A state variable `entity` and state setter function `setEntity` are declared using `useState` hook. These cloak the `Entity` object which contains the `initialValue`, `debounce` and a reference to a 'previous data' handling function.


- `useEffect(() => entity.handleChange(...), [entity]);` and `useLayoutEffect(() => () => {...}, []);`: These `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks are in place to handle side effects. The first `useEffect` executes `handleChange` function whenever the `entity` state changes. The `useLayoutEffect` ensures dropping of change events and marking the component as disposed as cleanup action when the component gets unmounted.


- `return useMemo(() => new EntityAdapter<T>(entity$, dispose$), [entity]);`: Finally, the hook returns a memoized version of `EntityAdapter` - an object that adapts the entity state for usage in application. This prevents unnecessary re-renderings and performance optimizations due to the `useMemo`.

So, to wrap up, the `useEntity` is a custom React hook that streamlines the state management process of an entity object leveraging TypeScript's static types and React's hooks.
If you need further explanations or have any questions, let me know.

## useEntityBinding

a custom hook named `useEntityBinding` in React, intended to deal with entities in your application. It uses concepts of state, references, and effects from React.

Now, let's break down the code:

This custom React hook `useEntityBinding` takes an object of parameters that includes a `creator` function for creating the entity, an optional `onChange` handler for when the entity changes, an `initialValue` for the entity and a default `debounce` value. The hook is using TypeScript generics and it's defined to work with objects that implement or extend the `IEntity` interface.

```typescript jsx
export const useEntityBinding = <T extends IEntity = any>({
    creator,
    onChange,
    initialValue,
    debounce = CHANGE_DEBOUNCE,
}: IParams<T>) => {
 
   // ...hook implementation ...
};
```

Inside the hook implementation, it utilizes following hooks and features: 

- `useState` hook : Initially, a `loading` state is defined and set to `true`.
- `useRef` hook: This hook is utilized to create a mutable reference, `initComplete`, which is initially set to `false`. Its value will persist through re-renders and doesnâ€™t cause additional renders when itâ€™s changed.
- `useEffect` hook: It is used for performing side-effects in function components.
- `handleChange`: This is a callback function that allows execution of the provided `onChange` handler with the given entity and a boolean indicating if it's the first time this entity is initiated.
- `useEntity` hook: This is a custom hook (likely defined elsewhere in your code) used to create an instance of the typed entity using the `initialValue`, the `handleChange` callback and debounce timing.
- `useChangeSubject`, `useSingleton` and `useChange`: These appear to be custom hooks defined elsewhere in your code. They involve RxJS observable Subjects, allowing you to emit and subscribe to changes, handle change events or create a singleton instance of the entity.
- `Subject<EntityAdapter<T>>`: `Subject` is a class from RxJS, and it is used here to instantiate an object `change` to publish the changes in an entity.
- `creator`: The function provided is called with entity, change, and an anonymous function.

Towards the end of the hook, it checks whether the entity is still loading. If it is, it returns `null`. When the entity has finished loading, it returns the `entity` object.

This hook provides a specific way to manage entity within your application including loading state, initialization, and handling changes.


## useFile

a custom React hook called `useFile`. It accepts an object of parameters that conform to the `IParams` interface, which can contain an optional `accept` string and an `onSelect` callback function. These parameters are destructured as arguments to `useFile`.

```typescript jsx
export const useFile = ({
  accept,
  onSelect,
}: IParams) => {
```

In the body of the hook, a `useRef` hook from React is used to create a ref object and store it in the `inputRef` variable. This variable is then used to store a reference to the file input element that is rendered by this hook.

```typescript jsx
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
```

The `onChange` function accompanies the `onchange` event of the file input element. It retrieves the list of selected files from the `files` property of the file input element referred by `inputRef`. After checking that files are selected, it calls the `onSelect` callback with the list of selected files as arguments. Finally, it clears the `value` of the input element to enable reselection of the same files.

The `render` function returns a file input element. The `type` attribute of this `input` element is set to `'file'`. The `style` attribute is set to `{ display: 'none'}` which hides the input directly, allowing custom styling elsewhere. The `onChange` function previously described is attached to handle the file input change events. The `ref` attribute is tied to `inputRef` to reference this element for file selection and the `accept` attribute is set to whatever was passed in the `accept` parameter of `useFile`.

```typescript jsx
const render = () => (
  <input
    type="file"
    style={{ display: 'none' }}
    onChange={onChange}
    ref={inputRef}
    accept={accept}
  />
);
```

Finally, the `open` function programmatically simulates a click on the file input element, which would open the file selection dialog box. This can be used to trigger file selection from another UI control.

```typescript jsx
const open = () => {
  inputRef.current?.click();
};
```

The `useFile` hook returns an object with two properties: `render` and `open`. The `render` property represents a function that returns the file input element, and `open` is the function that opens the file selection dialog.

```typescript jsx
return {
  render,
  open,
};
```

In summary, `useFile` is a React hook that abstracts the creation, handling, and rendering of a file input element in a React component. It's used to get the selected files when the user selects files from the file selection dialog box. The actual input field is hidden with the intent that actual interaction be customized and programmatically triggered via the provided `open` function.


## useForceUpdate

a custom hook in React named `useForceUpdate`. This hook utilizes the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks from React. Here's a breakdown:

1. `const [, setState] = useState(true)` - This code calls the `useState` hook from React, which returns an array with two elements. The first element is the state variable itself, and the second element is a function to modify that state variable. In this case, the state variable is not needed, so it's ignored with the empty portion of the destructuring assignment. The purpose of this state variable is just to trigger a re-render of the component whenever its state changes.

2. `return useCallback(() => {...}, []);` - This hook returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. In this case, the empty dependency array `[]` means that the function never has to be recomputed, as it has no dependencies.

3. `setState(s => !s)` - The returned callback function, when invoked, toggles the state value between `true` and `false`. This forces a re-render of the component that uses this hook, as React components re-render whenever their state changes.

In conclusion, the `useForceUpdate` hook provides a way to force a component to re-render itself. By calling the function returned by this hook, a component can cause itself to be updated, even if its props or state otherwise haven't changed.

## useList

a hook named `useList` which creates and controls a UI for picking items from a list. The hook exports a function `useList` that takes an object of options to configure the ListPicker. 

First, the hook defines an object of initial state using the `useActualCallback` hook with a set of default values. Then it defines the state named `state$` using the `useActualRef` hook initialized with the initial state. 

The hook uses `useEffect` to reset individual state properties when the ListPicker is not open and a state property changes.

The `handleChange` function handles a change event by calling the `changeRef.current` function if it exists, and then it resets the state and calls `hideModal` to hide the modal.

The `useModal` hook is used to show or hide the modal when necessary. The `ListPicker` component is rendered inside the modal with the specified configurations. 

The hook returns a function that creates and shows a new instance of a class which represents the modal. This returned function allows the title, minHeight, minWidth, and selectedRows to be overridden by parameters passed when calling it. The class has a `then` method to handle the data passed when modal is dismissed and a `toPromise` method to await the data passed when the modal is dismissed.

Here is a brief summary of how various pieces work or are expected to work:

- `IRowData` represents the row data.
- `SelectionMode` are the available selection modes for the ListPicker i.e., Single or Multiple.
- `useActualCallback` is a custom hook that presumably returns a function that always has the same identity.
- `IState` is an interface that describes the state of ListPicker.
- `useActualRef` is another custom hook that likely provides a â€˜refâ€™ object with a stable `.current` property.
- `useModal` is a custom hook that is expected to provide functionality for showing and hiding the modal.
- `Subject` is a class that most likely wraps some form of a promise-based or event-based operation.
  The `next` method is used to emit a specified piece of data, while  `toPromise` converts an observer-based asynchronous operation into a promise-based operation.
  
The `useList` hook can be used like this:

```typescript
const pickList = useList({ 
  ...options 
  // handler, columns, rowActions, payload, features,
  // selectionMode, title, minWidth, minHeight, selectedRows
});
pickList().then((data) => {
  // do something with the selected data
});
```

The exact usage might differ based on your application's modal system and observables implementation. Note that it's recommended to explore the definitions of custom hooks and utility classes for an absolute understanding.

## useListEditor

a custom React hook called `useListEditor`. This custom hook is a tool that manages an editable list of items. The item data is represented by a generic `Data` type that could be any type you specify. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the functionality:

- It first takes a rendering function `renderItem` as a parameter. This function is externally defined and is responsible for constructing the UI for each item in the list. The function should take two parameters: an id and the item data.

- The second parameter the hook takes is an options object containing `initialValue` and `onChange` properties. `initialValue` represents the initial list of items; if not provided, an empty array is used. The `onChange` function is an optional callback that is launched when the item list changes.

- Inside `useListEditor`, the code initializes a state `items` via the `useState` hook that holds a map of the item list where keys are item ids and values are item data.

- The `onAddItem` function adds an item to the list, generating a unique ID for it and adding it to the map. Then it updates the `items` state with the updated map.

- The `onRemoveItem` function removes an item from the list based on the provided ID.

- The `onUpdateItem` function updates an item in the list with new data according to the provided ID.

- The `itemList` contains the item data without the ids, derived from the `items` map and updated whenever `items` changes. If `onChange` was provided in options, it is called with the updated item list whenever it changes, except for the initial run.

- The `render` function takes care of rendering the list of items based on the passed `renderItem` function.

- Finally, it returns an object exposing `onAddItem`, `onUpdateItem`, `onRemoveItem` functions for adding, updating, removing items respectively, along with the `items` state holding the actual item list data and the `render` function.

Here is the JSX code with imports for context:

```typescript jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo, useEffect, useRef, Fragment } from "react";

type RowId = number;
  
// useListEditor Hook definition goes here...
```
You would use this hook when you need to administer an editable list of items in your React component, where the list can be manipulated through add, remove, and update operations. The `onChange` callback enables your component to respond to changes in the item list.

## useLocalHistory

a custom React hook named `useLocalHistory`. It creates and manages a unique memory history object that synchronizes with a higher level (parent) history object if such an object is provided.

This hook is particularly useful when you want to have a local copy of the global routing history in a nested portion of your application or when you need to simulate browsing behavior for testing.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It receives an options object as an argument, which should include an `upperHistory` property and an optional `pathname` property. If `pathname` is not provided, it defaults to "/". The shape of the options object is described by a `Partial<IParams>`, meaning that all of its properties are optional.

2. It then uses the `useMemo` hook to create a memory history object. It accepts an options object that includes an `initialEntries` property. This property is an array of initial URLs in the history stack. In this case, it uses the `pathname` from the upper history object (if available) or the provided `pathname`.

3. It then uses the `useEffect` hook to set up a listener on the `upperHistory` object (if it exists). This listener will listen to `PUSH` and `REPLACE` actions. When a `PUSH` action occurs, a new entry is added to the memory history stack. When a `REPLACE` action occurs, the current entry in the memory history stack is replaced.

4. Finally, it returns an object containing the local history instance.

This hook heavily relies on the `history` library, which provides a way of managing session history in JavaScript environments. The library includes `createMemoryHistory`, a function that creates an in-memory history object which does not interact with the browser's URL. This is particularly useful for testing and non-browser environments such as React Native.

The TypeScript interfaces and other React hooks imported at the provided code snippets help to shape types and utilize React functionalities, but they are used out of context from the provided hook code, meaning they are used somewhere else inside your project.

## useMediaContext

a hook called `useMediaContext`. This function uses the `@mui/material` package's `useMediaQuery` hook and the `react` package's `useMemo` hook to determine some properties of the current device based on its screen size.

Here's what the function does: 

1. It calls the `useMediaQuery` hook to check if the current device's screen size matches certain media queries. Essentially, the function uses the `Theme` provided (part of `@mui/material`) to seize breakpoints to define different devices' screen sizes. This is done for 'xs' (extra small devices, typically phones), 'sm' (small devices, typically tablets), and 'lg' (large devices, typically desktops).
   
2. After obtaining the device matches:
   - `isPhone` is true if the device is a phone
   - `isTablet` is true if the device is a tablet 
   - `isDesktop` is true if the device is a desktop 
   - `isWide`, returns true if the device is either a desktop or a tablet
   - `isMobile` is equivalent to `isPhone`

3. Then it uses the `useMemo` hook from the `react` package to return an object containing these properties (`isPhone`, `isTablet`, `isDesktop`, `isWide`, `isMobile`). This object is cached and will only be recomputed if any of the previously defined constants change.

Effectively, `useMediaContext` provides a way to get information about the current screen size in the form of these boolean properties. It can be useful for responsive design, allowing components to adapt their behavior based on the device's screen size.

## useMediaStreamBuilder

A hook called `useMediaStreamBuilder` is used for creating and managing media streams. These streams are used to capture screen, audio, and video via the WebRTC API. It takes an options object with various configuration, callback functions, and fallback behaviors.

Here is a detailed description of key elements of the code:

- The utility function `useMediaStreamBuilder` is exported from this module. It accepts a parameters object, `params`, with default parameters provided if none are given (`= {}`).

- A number of state variables are initialized with `useState("");` which store 'IDs' of currently active capture processes for audio, video and screen capture.

- The function `useActualValue` is used to stay updated with the current state of these capture Ids.

- `useActualCallback` is used to initialize request functions that capture screen, audio, and camera content.

- Three async functions `requestScreenCapture`, `requestCameraCapture` and `requestAudioCapture` are implemented. They set up the capture process by calling appropriate WebRTC methods, keep track of previously active captures, handle errors, and notify external callers (via callback functions) about changes in capture status.

- MediaStream object is a collection of captured media stream tracks.

- If successful, these functions update the relevant stream captures Ids and add new track to the media stream. It also triggers a debounced (delayed) callback `onChange` with new media stream and capture IDs.

- Error handling is built into these functions. If an error occurs while capturing, the error is either thrown or passed to a fallback function (depending on the `throwError` parameter).

- The function `stopScreenCapture` and `stopCameraCapture` are used to stop the relevant capture processes.

This code contains promise-based try/catch/finally blocks to handle asynchronous operations and potential errors. It also provides hooks/callbacks for external components to react to changes in media capture.

The utility function is likely designed for use within a React component, given the use of React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`), although the code for the hooks `useActualValue`, `useSingleton` and `useActualCallback` is not shown in the provided script.

## useModel

a custom React hook named `useModel`, intended for creating and managing a model object for a given value.

### Parameters:

The `useModel` hook accepts an object of parameters (`IParams<T>`) that include:

- `initialValue`: Specifies the initial value of the model.
- `onChange`: Optional function that is invoked whenever the model's value changes.
- `debounce`: Optional parameter that denotes the time interval (in milliseconds) that the hook waits before handling changes to the model's value, thus bunching/grouping rapid, successive changes together. If no value is provided, the `CHANGE_DEBOUNCE` constant is used as the default debounce interval.

The `useModel` hook operates on generic type `T`.

### Inside the Hook:

- Model references: `model$` and `dispose$` are `useRef` and `useSingleton` hook calls respectively. It provides a way to keep mutable values across re-renders of the component without causing additional renders.

- The `handlePrevData` function defined with `useCallback` returns the current data of the model. This function gets memoized and only updates if its dependencies change (no dependencies in this case, hence []).

- Model initialization: `useState` is used to initialize the model. On the first rendering, it constructs a new Model with the initial value, debounce, and handlePrevData function.

- Assigning current model to the `model$` reference: For every render, it assigns the current model to the `model$` reference.

- The `handleChange` callback: Creates a memoized version of the `onChange` callback received in the parameters.

- Use of the `useEffect` hook: This handles updates to the model when it changes.

- Use of the `useLayoutEffect` hook: To perform some cleanup when the component is unmounted or before it is re-rendered (this is where it drops any changes).

- Returned value: It uses `useMemo` to return a new instance of `ModelAdapter` only when the model changes.

Please note that in this hook, functions like `useSingleton`, `useActualCallback`, and classes like `Model`, `ModelAdapter`, `BehaviorSubject` appear to be user-defined. Their behavior may significantly affect how this hook operates; hence, it could be beneficial to have their definitions for further analysis.

## useModelBinding

a custom hook called `useModelBinding` that manages data binding and state management, using the concept of React hooks. The custom `useModelBinding` hook is generic as it uses the placeholder `T`, which extends an empty object `{}` with a default value `any`, representing any data model type.

The custom hook, `useModelBinding`, accepts an argument `IParams<T>`, an interface, which contains `initialValue`, `creator`, `onChange`, and `debounce`.

Here's a brief explanation of each parameter:

1. `creator` is a callback function that initializes the model.
   
2. `onChange` is an optional callback function which is called whenever the model changes.
   
3. `initialValue` is an optional initial value for the model.
   
4. `debounce` (a programming technique to throttle events) is also optional and has a default value from `CHANGE_DEBOUNCE` imported from the `Model` module.

The `useModelBinding` hook begins by initializing the `loading` state to `true` and declaring a `loading` setter function `setLoading` to update that state with the `useState` hook. It also declares a mutable reference `initComplete` using `useRef` initialized as `false`.

It then declares an instance of `model` using the `useModel` hook, a change event `emit` using `useChangeSubject` hook, and a singleton `change` event using `useSingleton` hook.

`useEffect` hooks are declared in situations where we depend on the change of certain values. The first `useEffect` is responsible for the lifecycle of the `emit` subscription. When then `model` is updated and it is not loading, it emits the updated `model` through the `change` event.

The second `useEffect` handles the lifecycle on component mount and invokes the creator function of the model with a callback for triggering further changes.

At the end, if loading is `true`, the hook result is `null`; otherwise, it returns the created model.

In sum, the `useModelBinding` function is a custom React Hook that deals with initializing, updating, and managing the lifecycle of a data model in a dynamically handled way, along with creating proper bidirectional data binding. This hook helps in working with complex models in React applications efficiently.

Please, let me know if you have any further questions or any other code to be explained.


## useOne

 a custom hook that returns a dynamically created class to manage modal state, specifically related to a form component used to pick a value from a group, possibly from a dropdown or overlay of some sort, given the context and some of the variable naming conventions.

Let's break down segment by segment:

- The `useOne` hook takes a parameters object as argument, where the object should have the match with the `IParams` interface. The types used - `Data`, `Payload`, `Field` - are generic and you can set them when calling the function. The `Field` type must extend from `IField<Data, Payload>`, meaning that it needs to be either `IField` or any type that derives from it. The `Data` and `Payload` types default to `IAnything` if not provided.

- Inside `useOne`, there are multiple calls to various hooks â€“ `useRef`, `useActualCallback`, `useActualRef`, `useEffect`, and another custom hook `useModal`. The code is saving references to certain values (like the handler function), it's setting up state via `useActualRef`, and it's calling some effect-triggered updates on this state. The hooks `useActualCallback` and `useActualRef` is a custom hooks that return a callback and a ref, respectively (though, without their definitions, this is just an educated guess based on their names).

- The `useModal` hook is used to create a modal with specific content. The callback provided returns a `OnePicker` component which receives various props. Some of them are directly from the parameters passed to `useOne`, like `large`, `fields`, `waitForChangesDelay` and `features`, while others are stateful like `title`, `handler` and `payload`.

- The returned value from `useOne` hook is a function that returns a new instance of a class. When you create this instance, it sets the state with a new handler, payload, and title (if they are provided), and shows the modal. You can then use the instance to handle promises with the `toPromise` method or to execute a function when the selected data changes with the `then` method.

It's important to note that the `OnePicker` component, `useActualCallback`, `useActualRef`, and the ultimate behavior and effects of these hooks were not given, so some assumptions had to be made based on typical conventions.

Also, there's a separate declaration `useOneTyped` is that is simply a typed version of `useOne` for cases where you're dealing with a `TypedField`, a specific implementation of `IField`.

This TypeScript code is a good example of creating a high order function that returns a class with promise-based API. It's a mix between functional programming (use of hooks and functions) and object-oriented programming (use of a class with methods).

## useOneArray

a custom hook in React, namely `useOneArray`.

It is designed to manage an array of data with an initializer, allowing flexibility with what type of data it manages through generics (the `<T = any>` part). You can read the code like this:

1. `useOneArray` is a function that takes in an optional argument `initialValue`, which can either be an array of any type (defaulting to any type if not explicitly declared), or a function that returns such an array.

    ```typescript
    export const useOneArray = <T = any>(initialValue?: ((T[] | null) | (() => T[]))) => {...}
    ```

2. Inside of the function body, a state is created named `data` and its setter function `setData`, both initialized using `useState`. The state's value is initialized with `result` which could either be an array or a return value of a function that itself returns an array, by checking the type of `initialValue`.

    ```typescript
    const [data, setData] = useState<T[] | null>(() => {
        let result = initialValue;
        if (typeof initialValue === 'function') {
            result = initialValue();
        }
        return Object.values(result || {});
    });
    ```

3. The value of `data` is then transformed into object values whenever `data` changes. This is an optimization using `useMemo` in React that only re-computes the `managedData` when `data` changes.

    ```typescript
    const managedData = useMemo(() => {
        return Object.values(data || {});
    }, [data]);
    ```

4. It finally returns a tuple of `managedData` (the transformed `data` array), and `setData` (the setter function) as constants.

    ```typescript
     return [managedData, setData] as const;
    ```

The purpose of this hook is likely to manage arrays in the state that are dynamically created or loaded and to return a version of said array that is optimized for re-rendering. You would use it in a component where you need to maintain an array in the state, and wish to have the advantages provided by the `useMemo` optimization.

## usePointer

a higher-order hook `usePointer()` which creates a pointer object to a reference object. This function is a React Hook because it uses the `useMemo()` hook. 

Let's break down the function:

1. The function `usePointer()` accepts an optional parameter `ref` of type `T`, which extends the object. This means this function can take any object as an argument. The `ref` parameter represents a reference object to create the pointer.

2. Inside the `usePointer` function, the `useMemo` React hook is used. The `useMemo` hook is used when you want to prevent expensive calculations unless the dependencies change, in this case, there are empty dependencies `[]`, so `useMemo` will only calculate once and then cache the result for every re-render.

3. `useMemo` returns the result of a function: in this case, it creates a pointer object from the reference object using the `createPointer` function. The pointer object consists of the properties `pointer` and `setPointer`.

4. The `createPointer` function (imported from `../utils/oop/Pointer`) is assumed to return an object with `pointer` and `setPointer`.

5. The function `usePointer` returns an array containing `pointer` and `setPointer` as a tuple. The use of `as const` makes TypeScript infer a readonly tuple, not a mutable array.

It appears that `usePointer` is designed to create a pattern similar to state hooks in React (like `useState`) where the first item is the state value and the second is a function to update that value. 

Here's a brief description of the imported functions used:

1. `useMemo`: A Hook from React library that will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

2. `createPointer`: A custom function that appears to create a pointer object. Details about its implementation aren't included in this particular piece of code, so we can only make assumptions based on its usage. The assumption is that it accepts a reference object, creates a pointer to it, and returns two things: the pointer itself, and a function to set or modify the original reference.

For more specific explanations, we would need the implementation of `createPointer()`.

Remember, TypeScript is just JavaScript with static type checking, which makes the code more robust and errors predictable as they are identified during compile time (or coding time).

## usePreventAutofill

a hook `usePreventAutofill` which is intended to prevent autofill behavior for `HTMLInputElement` in web browsers. This function is used preferably with React functional components as it makes use of Hooks.

Let's break down the function:

The `usePreventAutofill` function takes an object with optional properties as a parameter. These properties are:
- `readOnly` - Specifies if the input field is read-only or not
- `onFocus` - Specifies a function to be called when the input field gains focus
- `onTouchStart` - Specifies a function to be called when a touch event starts within the input field
- `onContextMenu` - Specifies a function to be called when the context menu event happens within the input field

The function `usePreventAutofill` utilizes a hook `useState` to manage a local readOnly state that is set to `true` initially. This readOnly state is used to control the `readOnly` property of the input component, and it's adjusted based on the focus and touch events.

useState is a hook that is used in functional components to simulate a state similar to class components. It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that allows you to update it. 

`useCallback` is another hook that is being used in the `usePreventAutofill` function to memoize event handlers to enhance performance by reducing unnecessary renders. 

The `usePreventAutofill` function returns an object containing:
- `readOnly`
- `onFocus` - A function that sets `readOnly` state to `false` when the input field gets focus and then runs the provided `onFocus` function
- `onTouchStart` - A function that sets `readOnly` state to `false` when touch event starts within the field and then runs the provided `onTouchStart` function
- `onContextMenu` - A function that prevents the context menu event (right click) and then runs the provided `onContextMenu` function

This `usePreventAutofill` function can be used inside the render method of a React component with JSX syntax like `{...preventAutofill}` to spread all the properties and event handlers to an `HTMLInputElement` preventing autofill behavior. 

In the provided examples, `usePreventAutofill` was used with `TextField` component of Material-UI and InputBase, setting these handlers and properties to those elements. 

`IParams` and `IResult` are TypeScript interfaces defining the structure of the object parameters to and returned by the `usePreventAutofill` function respectively. They define the types and possible values for a more robust and safer code. 

```typescript
export const Search = ({
  className,
  style,
  sx,
}: ISearchProps) => {
  //.. other code
  const preventAutofill = usePreventAutofill();
  return (
    <InputBase
      { ...someProps }
      {...preventAutofill}
    />
  );
};
```

In the above code snippet, the `usePreventAutofill` hook is used in the `Search` component. The object returned by `usePreventAutofill` function is assigned to `preventAutofill` variable and spread on `InputBase` component, which injects the focus, touchstart and contextmenu handlers to the `InputBase` component to prevent autofill behavior. 

Thus, `usePreventAutofill` provides a configurable framework to handle and control autofill behavior in form elements within a React application.

Notice: `usePreventAutofill` hook should be used within a React component or another hook and cannot be used in regular JavaScript functions according to the rules of Hooks in React.

## usePrompt

the purpose of `usePrompt` is the creation and display of a prompt modal. It takes a configuration object `usePrompt` as a parameter. This object might contain properties like `title`, `value`, `placeholder`, `canCancel`, and `large`, which configure the characteristics of the prompt modal. If certain properties are not specified by the caller, they receive a default value.

Internally, `usePrompt` makes use of several hooks:

- `useRef` to store a reference to the `handleChange` function.
- `useActualCallback` to create a function that returns the initial state.
- `useActualRef` to store the current state and an update function.
- `useEffect` to update the state.
- `useModal` to render and control a modal.

When called, this hook returns a function that, when subsequently called, will create a new class instance that interacts with the prompt modal. This process involves setting and updating the state, as well as showing the modal.

The class in question has a constructor that sets the current state, and it also has `then` and `toPromise` methods. The `then` method allows assigning passed callback to `changeRef.current` and `toPromise` method converts result to resolved promise.

The `render` function passed to `useModal` returns `PromptPicker`, a React component, which presumably provides the UI for the prompt modal.

PromptPicker gets properties about whether the modal is open, whether it is large, whether it can be cancelled, the title, the current value, the placeholder, and a function to call when a change occurs.

Finally, it invokes the `showModal` function when a new class instance is created, bringing the prompt modal to the front.

In short, `usePrompt` is a flexible, ready-to-use hook for creating, handling a prompt modal in a React application. "Modal" here refers to a dialog box or popup window that is displayed on top of the current page. The use of hooks and context here is a typical pattern seen in complex React applications.


## useQueuedAction

 a custom React hook function named `useQueuedAction`. The `useQueuedAction` function helps in executing an asynchronous action where it can queue calls, while also providing a loading state and error state. This is particularly useful for actions such as making API requests where you might want to handle subsequent calls in an orderly fashion and also manage their loading and error states.

It takes a function named `run` and an `options` object as arguments. The `run` function is the action to be executed - it takes a payload and returns a `Data` type result or a promise of the same, whereas the `options` object can have optional callback functions and a `throwError` flag.

Here are the key parts of the code:

1. The `useState` hook is used to create a `loading` and `error` state.

2. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable reference object `isMounted` which tells if the component is currently mounted.

3. `useLayoutEffect` is used to set `isMounted` to `false` when the component unmounts.

4. The `useMemo` hook is used to create `execution` and `execute` functions. These functions are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- The `execution` function takes a payload, executes the `run` function, sets loading to true before and false after the `run` function executes, and sets the error state if any error occurs.

- The `execute` function is a wrapper around `execution` which checks if the component is still mounted before updating the states. It also implements the error handling logic - on error, it either runs a `fallback` function if provided and `throwError` is `false`, or re-throws the error.

5. `execute` function is also bestowed with `clear` and `cancel` methods.

6. The returns an `execute` function along with `loading` and `error` states.

The `useQueuedAction` function is mainly used to handle queueing of asynchronous actions and handling their loading and error states in your React application to ensure smooth user experience.

The supporting types and additional hooks used (`IParams`, `IResult`,`useActualCallback`, etc.) provide the necessary typing and extra functionality needed for `useQueuedAction` to work.


## useReloadTrigger

a React hook named `useReloadTrigger`. This hook is designed to set up a trigger for reloading some data. The hook accepts an optional parameter, `autoReload`, which represents an interval in milliseconds to automatically trigger a reload. If `autoReload` is not provided, its default value would be 0, meaning the auto-reloading is disabled.

Here's a breakdown of this code:

1. Let's start with the import statements:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import randomString from "../utils/randomString";
const INITIAL_VALUE = randomString();
```

`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` are essential built-in React hooks. The `randomString` function is an external utility that presumably generates a random string.

2. The hook begins by initialising a state `reloadTrigger` with the initial value being a random string provided by the `INITIAL_VALUE` constant. This state and its setter function, `setReloadValue`, are managed by the `useState` hook.

```typescript
const [reloadTrigger, setReloadValue] = useState(INITIAL_VALUE);
```

3. The `useCallback` hook defines `doReload`, a function that changes `reloadTrigger` to a new random string whenever it is called. The dependency array being empty ([]), this function is memoized and doesn't change across re-renders.

```typescript
const doReload = useCallback(() => setReloadValue(randomString()), []);
```

4. The `useEffect` hook is used to set up an optional timeout for automatic reloading, based on the `autoReload` parameter. The cleanup function provided to `useEffect` will clear the timeout, if one was set, when the hook unmounts or re-runs.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    let timeout: any;
    if (autoReload) {
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            timeout = undefined;
            doReload();
        }, autoReload);
    }
    return () => {
        if (timeout !== undefined) {
                clearTimeout(timeout);
            }
        };
    }, [reloadTrigger, autoReload, doReload]);
```

5. The function finally returns an object containing the current `reloadTrigger` value and the `doReload` function. This object can be used by the consumer of the hook to manually trigger a reload or react to changes of the reload trigger.

```typescript
return {
    reloadTrigger,
    doReload,
};
```

In summary, this hook is a tool to help control data reloading. It can enable automatic data reloading at fixed intervals, or provide a control for manual reloading. The `reloadTrigger` returned by the hook can be watched by effects that need to perform actions (like fetching new data) upon a reload.


## useRenderWaiter

a custom hook `useRenderWaiter`. Hooks are a feature in React that allow you to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components, you can even write your own hooks to create reusable logic.

The hook `useRenderWaiter` is created with possibly two parameters `deps` and `delay`. `deps` is an optional array of dependencies, whenever one of these dependencies change, the hook will trigger a re-render of the component. `delay` is an optional value indicating the delay in milliseconds before triggering the re-render, default value is 0.

There are several hooks used in the function:

- `useRef`: Creates a mutable instance field on the current component instance. If the ref object is created in `useRenderWaiter`, it will remain the same betweens renders.
- `useEffect`: This hook lets you perform side-effects in the component. Side effects could be data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM, etc. The effect will run after every render when `initialChange.current` is false.
- `useCallback`: Returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. 

In this case, the hook creates a mechanism that, after the specified `delay`, will trigger a component re-render via a promise mechanism when the specified dependencies are changed. This can be useful in situations where, for example, a component must wait for some data to arrive and only then make a render update.

Here is a breakdown:

```typescript
export const useRenderWaiter = (deps?: any[], delay = 0) => {
  // initializes a reference to true for the first render
  const initialChange = useRef(true);  
  
  // creates a subject using the useSubject hook
  const subject = useSubject<void>();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // this code runs after the component is mounted and after every component update
    // And it will check if this is not the initial rendering
    if (initialChange.current) {
      initialChange.current = false;
      return;
    }
    // If there's a delay, it will call the next function on the subject after that delay.
    // Else, it will call the next function immediately.
    if (delay) {
      setTimeout(subject.next, delay);
      return;
    }
    subject.next();
  }, deps); //deps determine when useEffect runs again.
  
  
  // emits an event immediately when component un-mounts
  useEffect(() => () => {
    subject.next();
  }, []);
  
  // Returns function that returns a promise that resolves when the next function is called on the subject
  // useCallback is used to memoize this function across re-renders
  return useCallback(() => new Promise<void>((res) => subject.once(() => res())), []);
};
```

The `useSubject` here is assumed to create a Subject, an entity that can have multiple subscribers that listen to new events/data.

The `next` method is used to trigger an event in the subject and the `once` method is used in `useRenderWaiter` to resolve the promise once the `next` method is triggered.


## useRequestSnackbar

It's a custom hook that shows a snackbar with request feedback based on certain parameters passed to it. Here are the main parts:

This hook accepts an object parameter  which can optionally have these properties:

- `message` is the message that will be displayed in the snackbar. The default value is "Client update successful".
- `noSnackOnOk` is a boolean indicating whether to show the snackbar when the request is successfully completed. The default is `false`.
- `loading` indicates whether the request is currently in progress.
- `error` is an error message indicating a server error during the request.
- `delay` is the duration for which the snackbar should be displayed. Default value is `AUTO_HIDE_DURATION`.
- `onClose` is a callback function that is called when the snackbar is closed. The default does nothing.

Here's what the hook does:

1. The hook first initializes a state variable `element`, which will hold the snackbar element.

2. It then uses `useSubject` to create `closeSubject`, which is used to emit events whenever the snackbar should be closed.

3. The `handleClose` function is defined to close the snackbar and notify anyone interested in the close event.

4. The `setSnackbar` function is defined to update the `element` state with a new `Snackbar` instance.

5. The hook then uses `useChange` to watch the `loading` and `error` states. If there's an error, an error snackbar is shown. If there's no error and loading is finished, it will either show a default snackbar or call the `onClose` callback with `true`.

6. The `render` function returns the current snackbar element.

The hook returns an object with the following:

- `beginWatch` which starts watching for changes in loading and error states.
- `resetWatcher` which resets the watch state.
- `stopWatch` which stops watching for changes in loading and error states.
- `render` which renders the snackbar element.

Note: The code assumes that the following hooks `useSubject`, `useActualCallback`, `useChange`, and utility function `randomString` are defined somewhere else in your code, but you haven't included them in your question so I won't be able to explain their internals.

The JSX code is for the `Snackbar` component which is created every time an error occurs or when the request is successful (and `noSnackOnOk` is `false`). The snackbar is displayed at the bottom center of the viewport, its content is either the `error` message or the `message` passed to the hook, and it hides automatically after a duration, defaulting to `AUTO_HIDE_DURATION`.


## useRouteItem

a custom React hook called `useRouteItem`. This hook is meant to interact with a route management system to provide the current route item based on the provided routes and history.

Here's an explanation for each part of the code:

```typescript
export const useRouteItem = <T extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>, I extends ISwitchItem = ISwitchItem>(routes: I[], history: MemoryHistory | BrowserHistory | HashHistory) => {
```
This line is declaring a generic function `useRouteItem` with two type parameters, `T` and `I`. `T` is expected to be an object (`Record<string, any>`) and `I` is expected to be of type `ISwitchItem` or derived from it. 

`routes` is an array of switch items representing different routes. `history` is an object that can be of type `MemoryHistory`, `BrowserHistory`, or `HashHistory`. These types are related to the "history" JavaScript library, which enables session history management and navigation.

```typescript
    const routeManager = useSingleton(() => new RouteManager<T, I>(routes, history));
```
In this line, a `Singleton` instance of `RouteManager` is created. This manager contains information about the routes and the history object.

```typescript
    const isMounted = useRef(true);
```
This line makes use of `React's useRef` hook to keep track of the component's mount status. The initial value is set to `true`.

```typescript
    const [item, setItem] = useState(routeManager.item);
```
This line is calling `React's useState` hook to create a state variable called `item` and a function to update that state (`setItem`). The initial state value is set to the current item in the `routeManager`.

```typescript
    useEffect(() => routeManager.subscribe(() => {
        isMounted.current && setItem(routeManager.item);
    }), []);
```
The first `useEffect` hook is used to subscribe to changes in the `routeManager`. Whenever the `routeManager` is updated, it checks if the component is still mounted (`isMounted.current`), and if it is, the state is updated with the new current item.

```typescript
    useEffect(() => () => {
        routeManager.dispose();
    }, []);
```
Here, a cleanup function for the `React's useEffect` hook is defined. After the component is unmounted, the `routeManager` is disposed to free up resources and avoid memory leaks.

```typescript
    useLayoutEffect(() => () => {
      isMounted.current = false;
    }, []);
```
This `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to signal that a component has unmounted by setting `isMounted.current` to `false`. This helps avoid state updates on unmounted components.

```typescript
    return item;
```
Finally, the function returns the `item` state variable. This would be the current switch item based on the provided routes and history.


## useRouteParams

a hook function named `useRouteParams`. This hook is designed to retrieve the parameters of the currently active route. It's built for applications employing a Single Page Application (SPA) model, where routes are managed client-side by JavaScript.

Here is a breakdown of the hook function.

```typescript
export const useRouteParams = <T extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>, I extends ISwitchItem = ISwitchItem>(routes: I[], history: MemoryHistory | BrowserHistory | HashHistory) => {
```
This is a generic function taking two type parameters:

- `T` which should be an object (Record of `string`, `any`), and it defaults to this object type. This type `T` is used to define the type of the route parameters.
- `I` must comply with `ISwitchItem` interface, and it defaults to `ISwitchItem`. This is used for the type of switch items or routes.

The function itself takes two parameters:
- `routes`: an array of `ISwitchItem`s representing individual routes.
- `history`: an instance of either `MemoryHistory`, `BrowserHistory`, or `HashHistory` which holds the history stack, location, and action. 

```typescript
const routeManager = useSingleton(() => new RouteManager<T, I>(routes, history));
```
A singleton instance of `RouteManager` is created or retrieved using `useSingleton` hook. `routes` and `history` are passed to the `RouteManager`.

```typescript
const isMounted = useRef(true);
```
`isMounted` is a reference variable that starts as `true`, which will be used to prevent updating state after the `useRouteParams` component is unmounted.

```typescript
const [params, setParams] = useState(routeManager.params);
```
State is created for `params` using `useState` and it's initialized with the initial route parameters retrieved from `routeManager.params`.

```typescript
useEffect(() => routeManager.subscribe(() => {
    isMounted.current && setParams(routeManager.params);
}), []);
```
The `useEffect` hook is used to set up a side-effect that runs after render. `routeManager.subscribe()` is called to subscribe to route changes. Whenever a change occurs, it checks if the component is still mounted(`isMounted.current`), and if so, it updates `params` with new parameters from `routeManager.params`.

```typescript
useEffect(() => () => {
    routeManager.dispose();
}, []);
```
This is a cleanup effect that runs when the component is unmounted. It calls `routeManager.dispose()` which will unsubscribe from `history.listen()` to stop listening to route changes.

```typescript
useLayoutEffect(() => () => {
  isMounted.current = false;
}, []);
```
The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to set `isMounted.current` to `false` when the component is unmounted. 

```typescript
return params;
```
Finally, the hook returns `params` which holds the parameters of the current active route.


## useSearchParams

a hook function named `useSearchParams`. This hook is used to retrieve and parse search parameters from the current URL's query string.

The type parameter `T` is defined with a default of `Record<string, Value>`, which means `T` can be any object where the keys are strings and the values can be any type defined in the `Value` type.

The hook function takes two parameters:
- `defaultValues`: An object or a function that returns an object. Its properties are the default values for the search parameters.
- `prefix`: A string used as a prefix for managing search parameters from same domain or different modules.

Internally, `useSearchParams` uses `useSingleton` function to create a single instance of the default values object. Then, it uses the `useMemo` hook from React to memoize the computation of the result, based on the dependency of `initialValues`.

The computation creates a new URL object from the current window's location. Then it initializes a `result` object with the spread `initialValues`. After that, it goes through each search parameter from the URL. If a search parameter's key starts with the provided prefix, it extracts the value, replacing the `begin` prefix from the key and adjusts the value according to its type â€” `boolean` (true or false), `null` or a `number`. If the value doesn't belong to any of these predefined types, the raw value is taken.

Finally, it returns the resulting object casted to `T` type.

Regarding the rest of the code, `useSearchState` is a hook that manages the search state object in the URL. It uses the `useSearchParams` hook to initialize its state and `useState` to manage its state. In addition, it updates and cleans the search state when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts using the `useEffect` hook.

Both of these hooks are designed to help manage search parameters in the URL, which may be useful when you want to share links to specific states of an application, or preserve application state across refreshes in a way that's native to the web.


## useSearchState

a custom React Hook that manages search state in the URL.

Here's a brief interpretation of what each section of the code does:

- It receives a defaultValues argument that specifies the default values for the search state object. This could be an object or a function that returns one. This function receives a second argument that defines the configuration for the search state's behavior.

- Inside the hook, the `useState` function is initially used with the `useSearchParams` hook and defaultValues to set the initial state. The `useSearchParams` hook is not provided in your attached code, but it's presumably a hook that extracts and returns search parameters from the URL.

- Two `useEffect` hooks are being used. The first `useEffect` runs when the `state` variable changes. Each time that happens, it dispatches an "update" action using the `dispatchState` function. This behavior is to synchronize the state changes with the URL search parameters.

- The second `useEffect` runs only when the component is unmounted (its return function serves as the cleanup function), it dispatches a "unmount" action also using the `dispatchState` function. This is primarily a cleanup operation - it removes the search parameters from the URL when the component using this hook is unmounted.

- `dispatchState` is a function that's responsible for two tasks:
   1. "update": It updates the URL's search parameters according to the current state and configuration.
   2. "unmount": It cleans up the search parameters in the URL when the component unmounts.

The hook returns the current state and a function to update the state (`setState`) as a constant array, making it available for usage in the consuming component. 

Please note that the specific behavior of the `useSearchState` hook (like managing the search parameters in the URL, delay timing for updates, and cleanup strategy) is highly dependent on the behavior of the `dispatchState`, `useSearchParams` functions and `ISearchStateConfig` interface.


## useSinglerunAction

a custom React hook called `useSinglerunAction`. In general a hook is a function that lets you interact with React's state and lifecycle features from function components.

This custom hook `useSinglerunAction` is used to handle asynchronous actions along with their associated loading and error states.

The hook function takes two generic parameters, `Data` and `Payload` which express the type of data that the asynchronous action will return and the type of the payload that the asynchronous action accepts, respectively. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of `useSinglerunAction`:

* It accepts two arguments: `run` which is the asynchronous action to be executed, and `options` which includes additional configurations for the hook. 
* The `run` function is expected to take a payload and return either Data or a Promise of Data.
* The `options` parameter can have four properties: 
  * `onLoadStart`: A callback executed when the asynchronous action starts
  * `onLoadEnd`: A callback executed when the asynchronous action ends
  * `fallback`: A callback executed when an error occurs if `throwError` is set to false
  * `throwError`: A flag used to determine whether to throw an error or call the `fallback` function when an error occurs. By default, this is `true`.

The hook makes use of several other hooks and utilities in its implementation:

* `useState` to maintain both the loading and error states of the asynchronous operation. 
* `useRef` to track the mount status of the component using this hook. The `isMounted` variable is used to prevent updating the state of unmounted components which is considered a React anti-pattern.
* `useActualCallback` and `singlerun`are also utilized, but without code or deeper context, it's difficult to explain these in detail.
* `useLayoutEffect` is used to change the `isMounted` variable to `false` when the component unmounts, preventing any state updates after unmounting.
* `useMemo` is employed to define `execute`, a memoized function that runs the provided `run` function with safe guards for loading state, error handling, and unmounted component state updates.

The hook function finally returns an object containing `loading`, `error`, and `execute`.

## useSingleton

a custom hook in React, `useSingleton`, that ensures the provision of only a single instance of a specific value within the lifetime of the React component where this hook is used. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the function provided does not create a new instance of the value on each render of the component.

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:

- The hook `useSingleton` is defined as a generic function which accepts a value of type `T`, or a function that returns a value of type `T`. The function returns a value of type `T`.

- Inside the `useSingleton` hook, `useCallback` from React is used to ensure that the `resolve` function does not change between renders, which could otherwise cause unnecessary re-renders. The `resolve` function will check if the provided value is a function or not. If it's a function, it will be executed and the return value is used; otherwise, the value is used directly.

- `useRef` is used to hold the provided value or the result from the function call. useRef provides a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument `EMPTY_VALUE`.

- The `EMPTY_VALUE` constant, defined with `Symbol`, is used as a unique identifier. Since every `Symbol` is unique, it provides a perfect solution to mark an uninitialized or empty state for `useRef`.

- Finally, the `useSingleton` hook checks whether `resultRef.current` is still holding the initial `EMPTY_VALUE`. If so, the `resolve()` function is called to obtain the instance of the value and this instance will be stored in `resultRef.current` which in turn will be returned by the `useSingleton` hook.

- For subsequent calls to `useSingleton`, as long as the component doesn't unmount, `resultRef.current` won't be `EMPTY_VALUE` and hence `resolve` won't be called again, ensuring that the same instance of `T` is used across multiple renders. 

- This pattern allows you to create a singleton object in a React component, which can be handy when the creation of the object is expensive.

Here is how to import it into the module:
```typescript
import { useRef, useCallback } from 'react'
```
and then, `EMPTY_VALUE` is defined as a unique symbol:
```typescript
const EMPTY_VALUE = Symbol('empty-value')
```

## useSource

a custom hook that performs certain operations on objects of `TObserver<Data>` type, probably something related to a custom implementation of an Observable pattern.

The custom hook is named `useSource` and is defined as a generic function with a single parameter `target`. It's important to note that the type of `target` can be either `TObserver<Data>` or a function that returns `TObserver<Data>`. The generic parameter `Data` could be any type and it proffers flexibility such that the custom hook can work with any observable data source type.

The custom hook uses two different hooks from React library:

- The `useEffect` hook is used to produce side effects in function components. In this case, the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is used to unsubscribe from the `TObserver<Data>` value if certain conditions are met.

- The `useMemo` hook returns a memoized value that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for expensive calculations, in this case, it's used to return a shared value from the observable data source.

The `useSingleton` which might be another custom hook is used to get the singleton instance of the target observable data source.

This custom hook essentially offers a way to subscribe and unsubscribe from an observable data source and returns a shared value from this data source. Whenever the target changes, the hook will make sure to unsubscribe from the old data source.

The `TObserver` model and `useSingleton` are not visible in the code you provided and it's assumed that these are defined elsewhere in your project. `TObserver` seems to be a class (or interface) that represents an observable data source with at least methods named `unsubscribe` and `share`. The `useSingleton` probably returns a singleton instance of its parameter.

The custom hook `useSource` and its internal logic might be an essential part of managing the data flow inside a React application, especially in cases when you're dealing with observable data sources.

## useSubject


The hook `useSubject` is a generic function which can be specialized for any type `Data`. It takes an optional target of type `TSubject<Data>` or `null`, which, if provided, is a reactive subject instance to which this new subject can be subscribed.

`const result = useSingleton(() => new Subject<Data>());`: This statement makes use of a custom hook, `useSingleton`, to create a single instance of `Subject<Data>`. The `Subject` class is a tool for creating new streams in Reactive programming. We are using `useSingleton` to ensure that every render uses the same instance of `Subject` and doesn't create a new one.

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in React components. In this case, it subscribes the `result` subject to the `target` subject if the `target` exists. 

In the `useEffect` hook function, it first defines `dtor`, an `undefined` reference which will hold the return value (destructor) of the `subscribe` function of the `target` subject if it's defined. The `subscribe` function returns a function that can be used to unsubscribe from the `subject`. So when the component using the hook unmounts, the cleanup function returned from the `useEffect` hook which is `dtor` will get called, cleaning up the subscription.

Finally, it returns the `result`, which is an instance of `Subject<Data>`.

So basically, the `useSubject` hook is used to create a singleton of a new subject that optionally subscribes to an existing subject, and should be maintained across renders of the consuming component.

## useSubjectValue


The function `useSubjectValue` is a react hook function that declares a stateful variable (using `useState`) and then subscribes to updates from a target observable subject (using `useEffect`). It sets an initial value for the stateful variable and then receives new values through a subscription to an observable subject.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- `export const useSubjectValue = <Data = any>(target: TSubject<Data>, value?: Data | (() => Data)): Data => { }:`
This declares a TypeScript function called `useSubjectValue`. The function is generic, it can work with any type indicated by `Data`, but by default, `Data` is `any`. The function takes two arguments:
    - The first argument `target` is an observable subject of type `TSubject` (which must have been declared somewhere else in the code), where `TSubject` should be an observable subject that holds values of type `Data`.
    - The second argument `value` is optional and can be either a value of type `Data` or a function that returns a value of `Data`. 

- Inside this function it first calls the `useState` hook to create a state variable (`data`) which holds the current value of the observable subject. It also provides a function (`setData`) that is used to update this state variable. It initializes this state variable with the provided `value` (if any).

- `useEffect(() => target.subscribe((data) => { setData(data); }), [target]);`:
This calls the `useEffect` hook, which takes a function that will run every time the values in the dependency array change. In this case, the dependency array only contains `target`, so the function will run every time `target` changes.
  - Inside this function, it subscribes to the `target` observable. Each time the observable emits a new value, it calls `setData` to update the state variable `data` with the new value. 

Finally, the function returns the state variable `data`.

So, this function is used to sync a state variable with a changeable value from an observable subject.

## useSubscription

a function `useSubscription` that takes as an argument another function `fn` that itself returns a function. The returned function from `fn` should not return anything, indicated by `void`.

The `useSubscription` function makes use of `useEffect`, which is a Hook provided by React. Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components.

`useEffect` accepts two arguments: a function and an array. The function is meant to perform side effects in the component. Side effects could be data fetching, subscription or manual changes to the DOM.

The array is the list of dependencies for this effect. If one of the dependencies changes, the effect is re-run. However, since the dependencies array in this code is empty (`[]`), the effect will only run once, similar to `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in class components.

It seems like this `useSubscription` is used to emulate a componentDidMount effect that will run a subscribe function (which returns an unsubscribe function). When the component unmounts, the unsubscribe function returned by the `fn` function will be called, effectively cleaning up the subscription. However, without seeing the actual usage of `useSubscription`, this is just an educated guess.

## useTime

a custom hook called `useTime`, which allows you to use a time picker with modal functionality.

Let's break down this function:

1. `useRef<Fn>()`: This line creates a mutable ref object where `.current` is initialized to be of function type `Fn` which takes in a `dayjs.Dayjs` object or `null`.

2. `handleChange`: This is a function that takes a time (type `dayjs.Dayjs` or `null`) as an argument and invokes the function that is currently referenced by `changeRef.current` with `time` as an argument. After the function call, it executes the `hideModal()` to close the modal. 

3.  `useModal(() => (...))`: `useModal` is a helper function that returns an object containing the `showModal` and `hideModal` functions. It takes a render function as an argument, which here is rendering a `TimePicker` component that is always open and has `handleChange` as its `onChange` event handler.

4. At the end, the `useTime` hook returns a function that returns an instance of an anonymous class. This class:

   - Calls `showModal()` upon instantiation.
   - Has a `then()` method which sets the provided function as the current `changeRef`.
   - The `toPromise()` method wraps the functionality in a promise. It works by creating a new `Subject` then setting the `next` method of this subject as the current `changeRef`. It then returns the result of calling `toPromise()` on the newly created `subject`.

Thus, the `useTime` function hooks into a modal system to provide a time picker. It returns a function whereby the returned object will show the modal when called, and provides a `then()` function to allow the caller to set a function to be called when the time is changed. A `toPromise` method is provided to promisify this for easy use with the async/await syntax.

Key concepts involved: 

- React Hooks: `useRef`.
- Custom Hook: `useModal`.
- The JavaScript concept of Promise is used for async handling.
- Anonymous class in JavaScript.
- Higher-Order Function: Function `useTime` returning a function.
- React JSX (JavaScript XML): For creating React elements/components using an HTML-like syntax.

Lastly, please let me know if you need further clarification or have more questions.

## useUserAgent

a custom hook that utilizes the React's `useMemo` hook. The code provided returns an object containing information based on user agent string provided by the client's browser. This function is primarily used to determine if the client is using an Apple Mobile device, namely an iPad, iPhone, or iPod.

Let's breakdown the function:

```typescript
useUserAgent = () => {
    return useMemo(() => {
        return {
            isAppleMobile: /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(window.navigator.userAgent),
        }
    }, []);
}
```

The function `useUserAgent` is a hook, which means it is a function that lets you use React features from function components. This hook in particular is using another React hook, `useMemo` which returns a memoized value, only recomputing the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. In this use case, it has no dependencies (indicated by the empty array `[]`), and thus will only compute once and then cache the result for all future renders.

The computed memoized value is an object that contains one property: `isAppleMobile`. This property is a boolean value that returns `true` if the `userAgent` string of the `window.navigator` object contains either "iPad", "iPhone", or "iPod". In simpler terms, this function will return `true` if the client's device is an iPad, iPhone, or iPod. 

Therefore, the `useUserAgent` hook is a utility for easily determining if the client is using an Apple mobile device.

## useWatchChanges

a custom React hook, `useWatchChanges`, that creates a mechanism to detect changes in a set of dependencies and trigger actions when those dependencies are changed.

Here's an overview of what's going on:

- The `useWatchChanges` hook takes an array of dependencies (`deps`) as an argument and returns an object that contains the methods and properties to watch for and react to those changes.

- Under the hood, `useWatchChanges` uses another custom hook called `useSubject`. This hook seems to create an instance of the `Subject` class, which is an implementation of the Observer pattern. This instance (`changeSubject`) is used for broadcasting notifications about changes.

- The `useChange` hook is invoked with a callback that triggers the `next()` function of `changeSubject` - effectively signaling that a change has occurred in the watched dependencies.

- The returned object also contains a custom hook called `useChanges` that is designed to be used within functional React components. This hook ultimately subscribes to `changeSubject` thus setting up the component to respond whenever `changeSubject` emits. The response is a state change, which will cause a re-render of the component.

In summary, this code sets up a system that will cause a state change (and thus a re-render) in components that are using the `useChanges` hook whenever dependencies managed by the respective `useWatchChanges` instance are changed.

Here is a breakdown of the methods:

- `useSubject<void>()` - Returns an instance of the `Subject` class (as defined elsewhere in your code).

- `changeSubject.next()` - When called, this emits an event to all subscribers indicating that a 'change' has occurred.

- `changeSubject.subscribe(() => { setState((s) => !s); })` - This listens for 'changes' and when a change event occurs it toggles the state of the component thereby causing a re-render.

- `next(data: Data)` - This method emits an event to all subscribers of the `Subject` instance.

- `subscribe(callback: Function)` - This method subscribes the provided callback function to the `Subject` instance. The callback will be invoked whenever the `next` method of the `Subject` instance is called.

- `emit(eventName: EventKey, ...args: any[])` - This method emits the specified event with the provided arguments to all subscribers of this event.

- `useChange(() => { changeSubject.next(); }, deps);` - This establishes a subscription that listens for changes in the specified dependencies and fires `changeSubject.next()` whenever a change is observed.
    
Please note that while I have done my best to provide an explanation based on the provided code and additional context, without more specific information about the definitions and implementations of certain items (like `useSubject`, `useChange`, or the exact behavior of the `Subject` class), some assumptions had to be made. You might need to look into the exact implementation of those parts for a fully accurate understanding.

## useWindowSize

a hook which listens to changes in window size and responds accordingly. This hook is called `useWindowSize`.

First, let's take a look at the type definitions to understand them better:

- `ISize` represents an object with the properties `height` and `width`. You didn't provide the specific definition of this type but it's commonly used to represent the size of a UI element, like the window in this case.
- `IParams<Size extends ISize>` is an interface defining the parameters for the `useWindowSize` hook. It contains a `debounce` property for debouncing the resize event, a `compute` function for size computation, and an optional `onResize` function which is a callback invoked when window size changes.

In the `useWindowSize` function definition:

- `debounce: delay = RESIZE_DEBOUNCE` allows for setup of a debounce delay. Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after a certain amount of time has passed between invocations, here, for the resizing events. `RESIZE_DEBOUNCE` appears to be a constant that isn't defined in the code snippets you shared, so its exact value isn't known.
- `compute = (size) => size as Size` assigns a default size computing function. By default, this function returns the input size as is.
- `onResize` is an optional callback function which is invoked when the window size changes.
- `useState<Size>(getWindowSize)` initializes a state variable with the current window size. This state variable (`size`) gets updated whenever window size changes.
- The `useEffect` hook adds an event listener for 'resize' events on the window. Whenever a resize event occurs, it calculates the new window size and checks if it's different from the current size stored in the state. If the sizes are different, it updates the state and optionally calls the `onResize` callback.
- `useActualValue` seems to be a custom hook which may be used to get the _actual_ current value of a state variable, but without its source code, I can't provide specific information about its workings.
- `useCallback` is a React Hook creating a memoized version of a function.
- At the end, the `useWindowSize` hook returns the current size of the window.

With this hook and the IActionModalProps interface, height and width of action modals can be dynamically adjusted based on window size. 

In the ActionModal component code which isn't fully included, LARGE_SIZE_REQUEST and SMALL_SIZE_REQUEST seem to dictate specific sizing preferences, reducing or hardcoding height and width attributes respectively.

All in all, this hook allows for responsive adjustments to interface components based on window size changes.
