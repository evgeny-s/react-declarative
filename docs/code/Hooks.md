# useActualCallback

The `useActualCallback` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to execute a callback function while preserving its reference and memoizing it with specified dependencies. This hook is similar to the built-in `useCallback` hook from React, but with an additional benefit of storing the latest version of the callback function using `useRef` hook. This ensures that you always have access to the latest state inside the callback, even if it has not been declared within the function's dependency array.

The `useActualCallback` hook takes two arguments: `run`, which is a callback function, and `deps`, an array of dependencies. If no dependencies are provided, an empty array is used. The hook returns the memoized callback function of type `T`.

Inside the hook, a `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable ref object that holds the value of the callback function. The latest version of the `run` callback function is assigned to the ref object's `.current` property.

The hook then uses the `useCallback` hook to return a memoized version of the `executeRef.current` callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for passing callbacks down to optimized child components that depend on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

Overall, the `useActualCallback` hook helps improve performance in React applications by memoizing callback functions and ensuring access to the latest state inside the callback.

# useActualRef

The `useActualRef` hook is a custom React hook that creates and manages a mutable reference to a state value. It takes an initialState as input, which can be a value of any type or a function that returns such a value. The hook first declares and sets up the default value using another hook called `useSingleton`. Then, it creates a mutable ref object using the `useRef` hook, initializing its current property with the default value. Next, it creates a new state update function called `handleState` using the `useCallback` hook. This function accepts either a new state value or a function that calculates the new state based on the previous one, and updates the reference with the new state value. Finally, it returns an array with two items - the state reference and `handleState` function, which are marked as read-only using `as const`. This hook allows you to use React's state functionality with a mutable reference, which is different from the `useState` hook. Instead of triggering a re-render when the state is updated, it allows you to access and update the current state value anytime without causing a re-render, which can be useful in scenarios where re-rendering is unwanted or expensive.

# useActualState

The `useActualState` is a custom React Hook that allows you to create a state and its updater function in a more efficient way. It takes an optional parameter `initialState` which can be a value or a function that returns the initial state. The hook uses `useState` to create the state and its updater function, with `initialState` as the initial value. It also creates a mutable ref object using `useRef` and updates both the state and ref whenever there is a change. The returned tuple contains the current state as a mutable ref object (`stateRef`) and a state updater function (`handleState`) that can be used for reading and updating the state respectively. This ensures that you always have access to the most up-to-date state within your callbacks.

# useActualValue

The "useActualValue" hook is a custom React function that allows you to manage and store a value without causing a re-render on each update. It accepts one argument, a value of any type (T), and returns a ref object. This hook initializes the ref with the provided value and updates its current property to always hold the latest value.

In simpler terms, "useActualValue" helps you keep track of a value in your React functional component without triggering unnecessary re-renders. It's particularly useful when you need to store and manipulate a value, such as in an animation or event handling, without the need for constant re-renders.

# useAlert

The "useAlert" hook is a powerful tool in React applications for managing alert modals. It allows you to easily display and control alerts with customizable content, such as title and description. The hook accepts an optional parameter of type "IParams" which defines the title, description, and whether to display a large alert.

To use this hook, you can define a function that accepts the desired parameters and returns an instance of a class. This class provides two methods: "then" and "toPromise". The "then" method allows you to pass a callback function that will be executed when the alert is closed. The "toPromise" method returns a Promise that resolves when the alert is closed.

The hook also uses other custom hooks, such as "useRef" and "useEffect", to manage the alert's state and update its content dynamically. It ensures that the alert's content is updated whenever there are changes, and it controls the visibility of the alert using a custom "useModal" hook.

Overall, "useAlert" provides a flexible and convenient way to manage alert modals in a React application, allowing you to create and control alerts with custom content and handle their closure events easily.

# useAsyncAction

The `useAsyncAction` hook in React is a custom solution designed to handle the lifecycle of asynchronous actions. It takes two parameters: the `run` function, which accepts a Payload type and returns either an object of Data or a Promise resolving to such an object, and the `options` object of type `IParams`, which defines four optional properties: `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `fallback`, and `throwError`.

The hook returns an object containing public states associated with the asynchronous operation, including `loading`, a boolean flag indicating whether the `run` function is ongoing; `error`, a boolean flag indicating whether the `run` function has encountered an error; and `execute`, a function that triggers the `run` function with a given payload, managing the lifecycle by setting `loading` to true at the start, attempting to run the `run` function, setting `error` on catch block if an error is thrown, and setting `loading` to false at finally block. This function is optimized for re-rendering performance using `useCallback`.

The hook also utilizes several subroutines, such as the `cancelable` function for creating cancelable async functions, the `useActualCallback` hook to ensure React's `useCallback` dependency array contains actual values, and React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks for managing local component state and storing mutable values, respectively. Additionally, it uses `useCallback` for memoizing function and `useLayoutEffect` to safely manage the unmounting state of a React component using an isMounted flag.

This TypeScript code is used in a React project, leveraging hooks and lifecycle events from the React library. The Typescript generics and interfaces provide strong type safety checks for this custom React Hook function. If you have any questions or need further clarification on specific parts of the code, please let me know.

# useAsyncProgress

The `useAsyncProgress` hook is designed to simplify the tracking of asynchronous processes that return a specific result, handle potential errors, and provide progress updates. It accepts two generic types, `Data` and `Result`, to define the data being processed and the expected result from the processing function. The hook requires two parameters: `process`, a function that processes the data and returns either an instance of `Result` or a Promise resolving to `Result`, and `options`, an object of optional parameters including callback functions that run under specific conditions during the process. The hook utilizes custom hooks and state management to handle stateful values and callback function instances throughout the component's life. The main functionality of this hook is defined by the `execute` function, which applies a processing function to each item and handles errors that may arise during the process. This hook provides a flexible way to handle data processing in an asynchronous manner with robust error handling and progress tracking capabilities.

# useAsyncValue

The `useAsyncValue` hook is a useful tool for handling asynchronous values in React functional components. It simplifies the process of setting up, executing, and handling the results (or potential errors) of asynchronous operations, particularly when dealing with fetch requests. The hook takes two parameters: a `run` function that returns the asynchronous data or a Promise resolving to it, and `params` which contain optional parameters for customizing the behavior of the async value. It initializes a state variable `result` to null and sets up an asynchronous action using the `useAsyncAction` hook. The action fetches data by running the `run` function and saves it into the `result` state variable. The hook also uses the `useEffect` to ensure that the action is executed whenever dependencies change. Finally, it returns an array with the current state of the async value, information about the execution of the async action, and a setter function for updating the async value.

# useAudioPlayer

The `useAudioPlayer` is a custom React hook that creates an audio player with control functions. It takes a parameter object defined by the `IParams` interface, which should include a string property `src` representing the URL of the audio file to be played. The hook uses `useRef` to keep track of the audio element and `useState` to manage whether the audio is currently playing. It also utilizes `useReloadTrigger` to trigger changes in the audio component. The hook returns an object with three values: `audioRef` (the ref to the audio element), `render` (the JSX rendering function for the audio player), and `play` (the function to start audio playing). This hook can be used in a component to create an interactive audio player for a specified source URL, allowing for easy management and control of audio playback in a React application.

# useBehaviorSubject

The `useBehaviorSubject` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to create and manage a BehaviorSubject instance within your component. It is a generic function that can be used with any type of data and accepts an optional argument for the initial value. The hook utilizes another custom hook, `useSingleton`, to ensure that only one instance of the BehaviorSubject is created and used throughout the component's lifecycle.

By using `useBehaviorSubject`, you can keep track of a piece of data, observe changes to it, and retrieve the current value at any time. This hook is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage shared state between components or perform reactive programming tasks in your React application.

# useChange

The `useChange` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to execute an effect function in response to changes in a dependencies list, similar to the built-in `useEffect` hook. It provides additional features such as the ability to start or stop watching changes and resetting the watcher. The hook takes three parameters: `effect`, which is a callback function to be executed when dependencies change; `deps`, an optional list of dependencies to watch for changes; and `stopWatchByDefault`, an optional boolean indicating whether the hook should initially stop watching for changes.

The `useChange` hook uses the `useRef` hook to create mutable ref objects `initialChange` and `stopWatch`. These objects hold the state of the watcher. `initialChange` is initially set to `true`, allowing the effect function to be executed only when dependencies have actually changed and not on the initial render. `stopWatch` is initially set to the value of `stopWatchByDefault`.

The `useEffect` hook is used to set up the watcher, which runs the `effect` callback upon a change in the dependencies contained in the `deps` list, except when `initialChange.current` or `stopWatch.current` is `true`. Inside `useEffect`, a default cleanup function (`Destructor`) is returned when `initialChange.current` or `stopWatch.current` is `true`. This function does nothing, and there are no cleanup actions performed before re-running the effect or unmounting the component.

The hook returns an object of utility functions that allows you to manipulate the watcher from a React component. These functions are enclosed in the `useMemo` hook, which caches the utility functions object and returns the same object on every render, unless one of the dependencies (`[]`, none in this case) changes. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when using these methods in a component. The returned utility functions are:

1. `resetWatcher` - Resets the watcher so that the `effect` will not be executed until dependencies change again.
2. `beginWatch` - Starts watching the dependencies and executes the `effect` when they change.
3. `stopWatch` - Stops the watcher from reacting to dependency changes.

# useChangeSubject

The `useChangeSubject` hook is a React Hook that creates and manages a reactive subject with an initial value and type (`T`). It allows for the emission of a change every time the given value is updated. The hook consists of two other hooks, `useSingleton` and `useChange`. 

The `useSingleton` hook ensures that there is only one instance of the `Subject<T>` class, which is used to manage the behavior of the Observer pattern within this codebase. The `useChange` hook triggers a side-effect whenever the `value` changes, passing this change to every observer of the subject using the `subject.next(value)` method.

In summary, `useChangeSubject` creates a "watcher" that observes changes to the `value` and alerts any observers/listeners about these changes using the reactive sequence in `subject`. This pattern is commonly used in projects built with RxJS, where `Subject`, `Observer`, and `Observable` are core concepts.

# useCollection

The `useCollection` hook is a custom React Hook that allows you to manage a collection of objects implementing the `IEntity` interface. It accepts an optional set of parameters and returns a `CollectionAdapter` instance.

Here's a summary of how the hook works:
1. The `useCollection` hook is a generic function that accepts an object of parameters with default values.
2. It uses `useRef` to create two mutable references: `collection$` to store the Collection instance and `dispose$` to store a BehaviorSubject instance.
3. `useCallback` is used to create a callback function `handlePrevData` that returns the items in the `collection$`.
4. `useState` is used to initialize a new Collection instance with the provided `initialValue`, `debounce` value, and the `handlePrevData` callback.
5. The first `useEffect` attaches a change handler to the Collection and updates `collection$` with a new instance whenever necessary.
6. The second `useEffect` ensures the cleanup function is invoked when the component unmounts, and it handles dropping changes from the collection.
7. `useMemo` is used to return a new `CollectionAdapter` instance whenever the collection changes.

This hook is likely used in a larger application that follows an MVVM pattern and utilizes RxJS, custom Collection and Entity classes to manage state. It can be used in a list component to manage tasks or notes, allowing operations like creating, maintaining, and deleting tasks or notes.

# useCollectionBinding

The `useCollectionBinding` is a custom React hook that allows you to bind a collection of entities to a component and provides callbacks for updating this collection. It accepts a parameter of type `IParams`, which includes the creator function, an optional onChange callback, initial value for the collection, and a debounce time. The hook returns the collection of entities or null if it's still loading.

The hook uses `useState` and `useRef` hooks to handle the loading state and track initialization completion. It defines a `handleChange` function to be used as the callback for the onChange behavior. It uses `useCollection` to maintain the collection of items, `useChangeSubject` and `useSingleton` for managing changes in the collection.

Inside a `useEffect` hook, it subscribes to the `emit` object and checks the loading and initComplete states before calling `change.next(model)` function. It calls the `useChange` hook to update the initComplete state based on the loading state.

Another `useEffect` hook is used to call the creator function and manage cleanup if necessary. Finally, it checks the loading state and returns null if loading is true or the collection if loading is false. The dependencies for this hook include other custom hooks and helper classes, which likely offer post-creation and pre-render behavior handling for the collection.

# useConfirm

The `useConfirm` hook is a custom React Hook that allows you to easily create and manage a confirmation dialog within your application. It takes an object `IParams` as its parameter, which can include `title`, `msg` (message), and `canCancel` (cancelability) properties. These parameters have default values set to an empty string for `title` and `msg`, and `true` for `canCancel`.

The hook uses the `useActualRef` Hook to track the state of the dialog, which is stored in an object `IState` that includes the current title, message, cancelability, and whether the dialog is open or not.

To manage the visibility of the dialog, the hook utilizes three `useEffect` Hooks that update the title, message, and cancelability when they're not open or their default values change.

The `handleChange` function is executed whenever there's a change in the state of the dialog, updating the state and hiding the modal.

The `useModal` Hook is used to manage the visibility of the dialog, providing `showModal` and `hideModal` functions to show or hide the dialog.

The hook returns a function that can display the dialog with optional parameters for title, message, and cancelability. When invoked, this function sets the state and shows the dialog. It also includes a `then` method to handle the outcome of the dialog and a `toPromise` method that converts the asynchronous operation into a Promise.

Overall, the `useConfirm` hook provides a convenient way to create and manage confirmation dialogs within your React application, utilizing Hooks, JSX, and async functionality.

# useContextMenu

The `useContextMenu` hook is a React function that allows you to generate and control a context menu with customizable options. It accepts an object `params` of type `IParams<T>`, and returns an object of type `IResult` with properties for handling the context menu and rendering its content.

The `params` object contains various properties such as:
- `keepMounted`: A boolean indicating whether the menu should remain mounted even when closed.
- `BeforeContent` and `AfterContent`: Optional React components to render before and after the menu items.
- `deps`: Dependencies to trigger a reload of menu items.
- `payload`: The payload object passed to menu item handlers.
- `onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd`: Callback functions invoked when menu items start or finish loading.
- `onAction`: A callback function invoked when a menu item is clicked, receiving the action string as an argument.
- `options`: An array of options to render as menu items.
- `fallback`: The component to render as a fallback during loading.
- `reloadSubject`: The subject to trigger a reload of menu items.
- `throwError`: A flag indicating whether an error should be thrown on loading failures.

The hook returns an object with two properties:
1. `elementProps`: An object containing properties for handling the context menu, including an `onContextMenu` function to specify the location of the context menu.
2. `render`: A function that returns a component (specifically, a Menu component) with menu items created based on the `options` prop. It also displays a loader (CircularProgress) if menu items are loading.

The `handleClick` function in the `elementProps` property is used to handle click events on the menu items.

The `useStyles` function is used to create CSS classes for styling the context menu and its items, employing Material-UI's approach of CSS-in-JS.

The hook also uses external custom hooks and functions like `useActualCallback`, `useAsyncAction`, and `useState`.

# useDate

The `useDate` hook is a custom React hook that provides an interface to interact with a date picker component. It returns an instance of a class that allows you to interact with the date picker using a Promise-based approach.

When you invoke the `useDate` hook, it creates a reference (`changeRef`) to hold a function that can accept either `dayjs.Dayjs` (for date manipulation) or `null`. It also defines a callback function (`handleChange`) that gets triggered when the selected date in the DatePicker changes. This function updates `changeRef` with the new date and hides the modal window.

The `useModal` hook is then invoked to render a DatePicker component within a modal window. This hook provides `showModal` and `hideModal` functions to display and hide the modal, respectively.

The returned anonymous class can be instantiated to call `showModal` and provides two methods: `then` and `toPromise`. The `then` method updates the `changeRef` with a passed function, while the `toPromise` method returns a promise that resolves with the selected date.

This hook leverages advanced TypeScript features and the React library to simplify managing the state of a date picker modal and provide an easy-to-use interface for working with the selected date.

# useElementSize

The `useElementSize` hook is a custom React function that allows you to easily calculate and update the size of an HTML element within a React component. It is generic over two types: `T`, which must extend `HTMLElement`, and `Size`, which must extend the `ISize` interface. This flexibility enables you to work with different types of HTML elements and size interfaces.

The `useElementSize` hook takes an argument called `options`, which is based on the interface `IParams<Size>`. This means that all properties in the `IParams<Size>` object are optional when calling `useElementSize`. The default value for this argument is an empty object.

The `options` properties and their roles are as follows:
- `defaultSize` sets the default dimensions (height and width) of the HTML element when they are not provided.
- `target` specifies the HTML element for which the size should be computed. If not provided, the component's own element is used.
- `closest` specifies a selector for selecting an ancestor element of the target element.
- `selector` specifies a selector for selecting a specific descendant of the target element.
- `debounce` specifies the debounce delay in milliseconds for resizing events.
- `compute` is a function used to compute the size object based on the raw size. The default is a type-cast to `Size`.
- `onResize` is a callback function invoked every time the target element's size changes.

The hook initializes several pieces of React local state and refs, including `elementRef`, `isMounted`, `height`, `width`, and the result of calling a custom hook `useActualValue(size)`.

The hook also uses `useLayoutEffect` to create a debounce function that delays the processing of the provided function, reducing how often it is invoked. This debounce function calculates the size of the target element and compares it to the existing size. If the size has changed, it sets the new size and calls the `onResize` callback if provided.

The hook creates an instance of the `ResizeObserver` class, which is a browser API that observes changes to an element's dimensions and calls the provided callback whenever these dimensions change. It uses the size computation and debounced function defined earlier to handle changes to the target element's size.

Finally, the hook returns an object containing a `ref` to the HTML element and the current size of the element. This allows the calling component to attach the `ref` to an element and get its current size.

In summary, `useElementSize` provides a convenient way to work with the size of HTML elements in React, offering functionality such as dimension observing and resizing debouncing.

# useEntity

useEntity is a custom React hook designed to manage the state of an "entity" object. An entity is defined as an object with properties, including an id. This hook allows you to create, read, update and debounce updates to the entity state in a similar way you would use useState for managing state in React.

The hook takes an object of type IParams as a parameter, which includes initialValue (the starting state of the entity), onChange (a callback function that executes when the entity state changes), and debounce (the delay in milliseconds before changes to the entity state take effect).

The hook uses useRef to create a mutable container, entity$, which holds the current entity. It also uses useState to declare a state variable, entity, and setEntity function to manage the Entity object.

To handle side effects, the hook uses useEffect to execute handleChange whenever the entity state changes, and useLayoutEffect to ensure dropping of change events when the component gets unmounted.

Finally, the hook returns a memoized version of EntityAdapter, an object that adapts the entity state for usage in your application. This prevents unnecessary re-renderings and optimizes performance due to the useMemo.

In summary, useEntity is a custom React hook that simplifies the process of managing an entity object's state, leveraging TypeScript's static types and React's hooks for efficient state management.

# useEntityBinding

The `useEntityBinding` hook is a custom React hook designed to handle entities within your application. It takes an object of parameters including a `creator` function to create the entity, an optional `onChange` handler for when the entity changes, an `initialValue` for the entity and a default `debounce` value. The hook uses TypeScript generics and is defined to work with objects that implement or extend the `IEntity` interface.

Inside the hook implementation, it utilizes React's `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` hooks. It also defines a `handleChange` callback function to execute the provided `onChange` handler with the given entity and a boolean indicating if it's the first time this entity is initiated. The hook also uses a custom `useEntity` hook to create an instance of the typed entity using `initialValue`, `handleChange` callback, and debounce timing.

Additionally, the hook uses custom hooks `useChangeSubject`, `useSingleton`, and `useChange` which involve RxJS observable Subjects, allowing you to emit and subscribe to changes, handle change events or create a singleton instance of the entity. The hook returns either `null` if the entity is still loading or the `entity` object if it has finished loading. This hook provides a specific way to manage entities within your application, including loading state, initialization, and handling changes.

# useFile

The `useFile` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to easily create and handle file input elements within a React component. It accepts an object of parameters that conform to the `IParams` interface, which can include an optional `accept` string and an `onSelect` callback function. The hook returns an object with two properties: `render` and `open`. The `render` property returns the file input element, which is hidden using CSS and can be styled elsewhere. The `open` function programmatically triggers the file selection dialog box, allowing you to open it from another UI control. The hook handles the file selection events and calls the `onSelect` callback with the selected files as arguments.

# useForceUpdate

The `useForceUpdate` hook in React is a custom function that allows components to force themselves to re-render. It utilizes the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks from React. The hook returns a memoized callback function that, when invoked, toggles the state value between `true` and `false`, triggering a re-render of the component. Since the dependency array is empty, the function never needs to be recomputed. This hook provides a way to update components even if their props or state haven't changed, making it useful for scenarios where you need to ensure a component re-renders, such as when implementing a feature like "refresh" or "update."

# useList

The `useList` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to create and control a UI for picking items from a list. It exports a function that takes an object of options to configure the ListPicker. The hook initializes an object of state using the `useActualCallback` hook with default values, and then defines the state named `state$` using the `useActualRef` hook initialized with the initial state.

The `useEffect` hook is used to reset individual state properties when the ListPicker is not open and a state property changes. The `handleChange` function handles a change event by calling the `changeRef.current` function if it exists, and then resets the state and calls `hideModal` to hide the modal.

The `useModal` hook is used to show or hide the modal when necessary, and the `ListPicker` component is rendered inside the modal with the specified configurations. The hook returns a function that creates and shows a new instance of a class representing the modal. This returned function allows the title, minHeight, minWidth, and selectedRows to be overridden by parameters passed when calling it. The class has a `then` method to handle the data passed when the modal is dismissed and a `toPromise` method to await the data passed when the modal is dismissed.

To use this hook, you can create a new instance of the ListPicker by calling `useList` with an object of options. The returned promise can then be used to handle the selected data in your application. Note that you may need to explore the definitions of custom hooks and utility classes for a complete understanding, as the exact usage may differ based on your application's modal system and observables implementation.

# useListEditor

The `useListEditor` is a custom React hook that allows you to manage an editable list of items in your React component. It takes a rendering function and an options object as parameters. The rendering function is responsible for constructing the UI for each item in the list, while the options object contains properties for initializing the list and handling changes.

Inside `useListEditor`, it initializes a state variable `items` using the `useState` hook to hold a map of the item list, where keys are unique IDs and values are item data. The hook provides functions for adding, removing, and updating items in the list. It also derives an `itemList` without the IDs and updates it whenever `items` changes. If an `onChange` function is provided, it will be called whenever the item list changes.

The hook returns an object with functions for adding, updating, and removing items in the list. It also includes the `items` state variable and a function for rendering the list of items based on the provided `renderItem` function.

You would use this hook when you need to administer an editable list of items in your React component, where the list can be manipulated through add, remove, and update operations. The `onChange` callback enables your component to respond to changes in the item list.

# useLocalHistory

The `useLocalHistory` hook is a custom React function that creates and manages a unique memory history object. This object synchronizes with a higher-level (parent) history object if one is provided. This hook can be useful for having a local copy of the global routing history in nested portions of your application or for simulating browsing behavior during testing.

To use this hook, you provide an options object as an argument. This options object should include the `upperHistory` property and an optional `pathname` property. If the `pathname` is not provided, it defaults to "/".

The hook then uses the `useMemo` hook to create a memory history object. This object accepts an options object that includes the `initialEntries` property. This property is an array of initial URLs in the history stack, using either the `pathname` from the upper history object (if available) or the provided `pathname`.

The hook also uses the `useEffect` hook to set up a listener on the `upperHistory` object (if it exists). This listener will listen to `PUSH` and `REPLACE` actions. When a `PUSH` action occurs, a new entry is added to the memory history stack. When a `REPLACE` action occurs, the current entry in the memory history stack is replaced.

Finally, the hook returns an object containing the local history instance.

This hook relies on the `history` library, which provides a way of managing session history in JavaScript environments. The library includes the `createMemoryHistory` function, which creates an in-memory history object that does not interact with the browser's URL. This is useful for testing and non-browser environments such as React Native.

The TypeScript interfaces and other React hooks imported in the provided code snippets help to shape types and utilize React functionalities, but they are used out of context from the provided hook code, meaning they are used elsewhere in your project.

# useMediaContext

The `useMediaContext` hook is a useful tool for creating responsive designs in React applications. It utilizes the `useMediaQuery` hook from the `@mui/material` package and the `useMemo` hook from React to determine the properties of a device based on its screen size.

First, the hook checks if the current device's screen size matches specific media queries, such as 'xs' for extra small devices (typically phones), 'sm' for small devices (typically tablets), and 'lg' for large devices (typically desktops).

Next, the hook assigns boolean values to properties based on these media queries:
- `isPhone` is true if the device is a phone
- `isTablet` is true if the device is a tablet
- `isDesktop` is true if the device is a desktop
- `isWide` is true if the device is either a desktop or a tablet
- `isMobile` is equivalent to `isPhone`

Finally, the hook uses `useMemo` to return an object containing these properties. This cached object will only be recomputed if any of the previously defined constants change.

By using `useMediaContext`, developers can create components that adapt their behavior based on the screen size of the device, making their applications more responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

# useMediaStreamBuilder

The `useMediaStreamBuilder` hook is used to create and manage media streams for capturing screen, audio, and video content using the WebRTC API. It takes an options object with various configuration, callback functions, and fallback behaviors. The hook initializes state variables for the IDs of currently active capture processes and stays updated with the current state of these capture IDs. It also initializes request functions for capturing screen, audio, and camera content.

The hook provides three asynchronous functions, `requestScreenCapture`, `requestCameraCapture`, and `requestAudioCapture`, which set up the capture process by calling appropriate WebRTC methods, keep track of previously active captures, handle errors, and notify external callers about changes in capture status. If successful, these functions update the relevant stream capture IDs and add new tracks to the media stream. They also trigger a debounced callback `onChange` with new media stream and capture IDs.

Error handling is built into these functions, with errors either thrown or passed to a fallback function depending on the `throwError` parameter. The hook also provides functions to stop the relevant capture processes. The code contains promise-based try/catch/finally blocks to handle asynchronous operations and potential errors, and provides hooks/callbacks for external components to react to changes in media capture. The hook is likely designed for use within a React component, utilizing React hooks such as `useState` and `useMemo`.

# useModel

The `useModel` hook is a custom React hook designed to create and manage a model object for a specific value. It accepts an object of parameters that include the initial value, a function to be invoked when the model's value changes (optional), and an optional debounce parameter that determines the time interval between successive changes. The hook operates on a generic type `T`.

Inside the hook, it utilizes `useRef` and `useSingleton` hooks to create model references (`model$` and `dispose$`) for maintaining mutable values across component re-renders. It also uses `useCallback` to define a function (`handlePrevData`) that returns the current data of the model, which gets memoized and updates only when its dependencies change.

Upon initialization, the hook uses `useState` to initialize the model with the initial value, debounce, and `handlePrevData` function. It then assigns the current model to `model$` reference for every render.

The hook also creates a memoized version of the `onChange` callback using `useCallback`. It uses the `useEffect` hook to handle updates when the model changes, and `useLayoutEffect` for cleanup when the component is unmounted or re-rendered.

Finally, it returns a new instance of `ModelAdapter` using `useMemo`, which updates only when the model changes.

# useModelBinding

The `useModelBinding` hook is a custom React Hook that provides data binding and state management capabilities. It is a generic hook that can work with any data model type, represented by the placeholder `T`. The hook accepts an argument of type `IParams<T>`, which includes the following parameters:

1. `initialValue` (optional): An initial value for the model.
2. `creator`: A callback function that initializes the model.
3. `onChange` (optional): An optional callback function that is called whenever the model changes.
4. `debounce` (optional): A debounce function that throttles events, with a default value imported from the `Model` module.

The hook initializes the `loading` state to true and declares a setter function `setLoading` using the `useState` hook. It also declares a mutable reference `initComplete` using the `useRef` hook initialized as false.

The hook then declares an instance of `model` using the `useModel` hook, a change event `emit` using the `useChangeSubject` hook, and a singleton `change` event using the `useSingleton` hook.

The first `useEffect` handles the lifecycle of the `emit` subscription. When the model is updated and it's not in a loading state, the updated model is emitted through the `change` event.

The second `useEffect` handles the lifecycle on component mount and invokes the creator function of the model with a callback for triggering further changes.

If the `loading` state is true, the hook returns null. Otherwise, it returns the created model.

In summary, `useModelBinding` is a custom React Hook that handles the initialization, updating, and management of a data model in a dynamic way, along with creating bidirectional data binding. This hook helps in working with complex models efficiently in React applications.

# useOne

The `useOne` hook is a custom React hook that manages modal state for a form component used to pick a value from a group, such as a dropdown or overlay. It takes an object with parameters that follow the `IParams` interface, and allows you to define generic types for `Data`, `Payload`, and `Field`. The `Data` and `Payload` types default to `IAnything` if not provided.

Inside the hook, it uses other hooks like `useRef`, `useActualCallback`, `useActualRef`, and `useEffect`. It also uses a custom hook called `useModal` to create a modal with specific content. The `useModal` hook returns a `OnePicker` component with various props, some of which are directly from the parameters passed to `useOne`, and others that are stateful.

The `useOne` hook returns a function that creates an instance of a class, which sets the state with new handler, payload, and title (if provided), and shows the modal. The class also provides a `toPromise` method to handle promises and a `then` method to execute a function when the selected data changes.

There is also a separate declaration `useOneTyped` for cases where you're dealing with a `TypedField`, which is a specific implementation of the `IField` interface. This TypeScript code demonstrates the creation of a high order function that returns a class with promise-based API, combining functional and object-oriented programming concepts.

# useOneArray

The `useOneArray` hook in React is a custom function designed to manage an array of data with flexibility in terms of the type of data it handles. It takes an optional argument `initialValue`, which can be either an array of any type (defaulting to any type if not explicitly declared) or a function that returns an array. The hook creates a state named `data` and its setter function `setData`, initialized using the `useState` hook. The value of `data` is transformed into object values whenever it changes, using the `useMemo` hook for optimization. The purpose of this hook is to manage arrays in the state that are dynamically created or loaded and to return a version of the array that is optimized for re-rendering. It can be used in a component where you need to maintain an array in the state and wish to have the advantages provided by the `useMemo` optimization.

# usePointer

The `usePointer` hook is a higher-order React Hook that creates a pointer object from a reference object. It uses the `useMemo` hook to prevent expensive calculations unless dependencies change. The `usePointer` hook accepts an optional parameter, the `ref`, which extends to any object type. Inside the hook, `useMemo` is used with empty dependencies, so it only calculates once and caches the result for every re-render. It returns an array containing the `pointer` object and a `setPointer` function as a tuple. The `createPointer` function, imported from the `../utils/oop/Pointer` file, is assumed to return an object with `pointer` and `setPointer`. The use of `as const` makes TypeScript infer a readonly tuple, not a mutable array. `usePointer` aims to create a pattern similar to state hooks in React, where the first item is the state value and the second is a function to update that value. The `useMemo` and `createPointer` functions are used for optimization and creating a pointer object respectively.

# usePreventAutofill

usePreventAutofill is a React hook that helps prevent autofill behavior in HTMLInputElement within web browsers. It can be used with React functional components and takes an object of optional properties as a parameter. These properties include readOnly, onFocus, onTouchStart, and onContextMenu.

The hook uses useState to manage a local readOnly state, which is set to true initially and used to control the readOnly property of the input component. It adjusts this state based on focus and touch events.

useCallback is another hook used in the usePreventAutofill function to memoize event handlers, improving performance by reducing unnecessary renders.

The function returns an object containing readOnly, onFocus, onTouchStart, and onContextMenu. These properties and event handlers are used to prevent autofill behavior when spread onto an HTMLInputElement within a React component's render method.

In the provided examples, usePreventAutofill was used with Material-UI's TextField component and InputBase, setting these handlers and properties to those elements.

The function also uses TypeScript interfaces IParams and IResult to define the structure of the object parameters and returned by usePreventAutofill, respectively. This helps ensure a more robust and safer code.

In the given code snippet, usePreventAutofill is used in the Search component, and its returned object is assigned to the preventAutofill variable. This object is then spread onto the InputBase component, injecting focus, touchstart, and contextmenu handlers to prevent autofill behavior.

Overall, usePreventAutofill provides a customizable framework to handle and control autofill behavior in form elements within a React application.

# usePrompt

The `usePrompt` hook is designed to create and display a prompt modal in a React application. It takes a configuration object as its parameter, which can include properties like `title`, `value`, `placeholder`, `canCancel`, and `large` to customize the appearance of the prompt modal. By default, any unspecified properties will have a default value.

Internally, `usePrompt` utilizes several hooks such as `useRef`, `useActualCallback`, `useActualRef`, and `useEffect` to manage the state, update the modal, and control its rendering.

When called, `usePrompt` returns a function that creates a new class instance to interact with the prompt modal. This involves setting and updating the state, as well as showing the modal. The class has `then` and `toPromise` methods to handle callbacks and convert the result into a resolved promise.

The `render` function passed to the `useModal` hook returns a React component called `PromptPicker`, which provides the UI for the prompt modal. `PromptPicker` receives properties such as the modal's state, size, cancel option, title, current value, placeholder, and a function to be called when the value changes.

Finally, `usePrompt` invokes the `showModal` function when a new class instance is created, bringing the prompt modal to the front. In summary, `usePrompt` is a versatile hook that allows developers to easily create and handle prompt modals in a React application, providing a convenient way to display dialog boxes or popup windows for user interaction.

# useQueuedAction

The `useQueuedAction` is a custom React hook that helps in executing asynchronous actions, particularly useful for tasks like making API requests. It takes a function `run` and an options object as arguments. The `run` function is the action to be executed, which takes a payload and returns either the result or promise of `Data` type. The options object can have optional callback functions and a `throwError` flag.

The hook uses `useState` to create a loading and error state, `useRef` to create a mutable reference object `isMounted` to check if the component is currently mounted, and `useLayoutEffect` to set `isMounted` to false when the component unmounts.

The `useMemo` hook is used to create `execution` and `execute` functions, which are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders. The `execution` function executes the `run` function, sets loading to true before and false after the `run` function executes, and sets the error state if any error occurs. The `execute` function is a wrapper around `execution`, checks if the component is still mounted before updating states, and implements error handling logic.

The `execute` function also has `clear` and `cancel` methods. The hook returns the `execute` function along with loading and error states.

The `useQueuedAction` hook is mainly used to handle queueing of asynchronous actions and managing their loading and error states in your React application to ensure a smooth user experience. The supporting types and additional hooks used provide the necessary typing and extra functionality needed for `useQueuedAction` to work.

# useReloadTrigger

The `useReloadTrigger` React hook is designed to manage data reloading in a component. It accepts an optional `autoReload` parameter, which sets an interval for automatic reloading. If no `autoReload` parameter is provided, the auto-reloading feature will be disabled.

The hook initializes a state `reloadTrigger` with an initial value generated by the `randomString` function. This state and its setter function, `setReloadValue`, are managed by the `useState` hook.

The `doReload` function, defined using the `useCallback` hook, changes the value of `reloadTrigger` to a new random string whenever it is called. This function is memoized and doesn't change across re-renders.

The `useEffect` hook sets up an optional timeout for automatic reloading based on the `autoReload` parameter. The cleanup function provided to `useEffect` clears the timeout when the hook unmounts or re-runs.

Finally, the hook returns an object containing the current `reloadTrigger` value and the `doReload` function. This object can be used by the consumer of the hook to manually trigger a reload or react to changes of the reload trigger. The `reloadTrigger` can also be watched by effects that need to perform actions upon a reload.

# useRenderWaiter

The `useRenderWaiter` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to create a mechanism for triggering a component re-render after a specified delay, only when certain dependencies have changed. This hook can be useful in situations where a component needs to wait for data before updating its render.

To use this hook, you can provide an optional array of dependencies (`deps`) and an optional delay value in milliseconds (`delay`, default is 0). The hook uses the `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` hooks internally.

The hook initializes a reference to `true` for the first render and creates a subject using the `useSubject` hook. The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects and ensure that the code inside runs after every render, except for the initial one.

If there is a delay specified, the `setTimeout` function is used to call the `next` function on the subject after the specified delay. If there is no delay, the `next` function is called immediately.

The hook also includes an additional `useEffect` to ensure that the event is emitted when the component un-mounts.

Finally, the hook returns a function that wraps an asynchronous operation in a promise. This function resolves the promise when the `next` function is called on the subject, thanks to the `useCallback` hook for memoization across re-renders.

# useRequestSnackbar

The `useRequestSnackbar` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to display a snackbar with request feedback based on certain parameters. It accepts an object parameter that can optionally include properties such as `message`, `noSnackOnOk`, `loading`, `error`, `delay`, and `onClose`. 

The hook initializes a state variable `element` to hold the snackbar element and uses `useSubject` to create a subject called `closeSubject`, which is used to emit events when the snackbar should be closed. It defines a `handleClose` function to close the snackbar and notify anyone interested in the close event. The `setSnackbar` function is defined to update the `element` state with a new Snackbar instance.

The hook then uses `useChange` to watch for changes in the `loading` and `error` states. If there's an error, it shows an error snackbar. If there's no error and loading is finished, it will either show a default snackbar or call the `onClose` callback with `true`. The hook returns an object containing functions to start, reset, and stop watching for changes in loading and error states, as well as a function to render the snackbar element.

The `Snackbar` component is created every time an error occurs or when the request is successful (and `noSnackOnOk` is `false`). The snackbar is displayed at the bottom center of the viewport, its content is either the `error` message or the `message` passed to the hook, and it hides automatically after a duration, defaulting to `AUTO_HIDE_DURATION`.

# useRouteItem

The `useRouteItem` hook is a custom React function that allows interaction with a route management system to provide the current route item based on given routes and history. It takes two type parameters, `T` and `I`, where `T` is an object and `I` is derived from the `ISwitchItem` interface. The hook uses the `useSingleton` function to create a Singleton instance of `RouteManager`, which contains information about the routes and history. It also uses `React's useRef` hook to track the component's mount status and `useState` hook to create a state variable (`item`) and its update function (`setItem`). The hook utilizes `React's useEffect` multiple times for subscribing to changes in the `routeManager`, updating state, disposing of the `routeManager` on component unmount, and signaling the component's unmount. Finally, it returns the `item` state variable representing the current switch item based on provided routes and history.

# useRouteParams

The `useRouteParams` hook is designed to retrieve the parameters of the currently active route in Single Page Application (SPA) models. It is a generic function that takes two type parameters, `T` and `I`, which define the type of route parameters and routes, respectively. The hook also requires an array of `ISwitchItem` representing individual routes and an instance of either `MemoryHistory`, `BrowserHistory`, or `HashHistory` to manage the history stack, location, and action.

The hook creates a singleton instance of `RouteManager` using the provided routes and history. It also initializes a reference variable `isMounted` as true and a state variable `params` using the initial route parameters from `routeManager.params`.

The hook sets up a side-effect using `useEffect` to subscribe to route changes. Whenever a change occurs, it checks if the component is still mounted and updates `params` with the new parameters from `routeManager.params`.

A cleanup effect using `useEffect` is also set up to unsubscribe from `history.listen()` when the component is unmounted. Additionally, `useLayoutEffect` is used to set `isMounted.current` as false when the component is unmounted.

Finally, the hook returns `params`, which holds the parameters of the current active route.

# useSearchParams

The `useSearchParams` hook is a function that allows you to retrieve and parse search parameters from the current URL's query string. It takes two parameters: `defaultValues`, which is an object or a function that returns an object, providing default values for the search parameters; and `prefix`, a string used as a prefix for managing search parameters from the same domain or different modules.

Internally, `useSearchParams` uses the `useSingleton` function to create a single instance of the default values object and `useMemo` hook from React to memoize the computation of the result, based on the dependency of `initialValues`. It then creates a new URL object from the current window's location, initializes a `result` object with the spread `initialValues`, and goes through each search parameter from the URL. If a search parameter's key starts with the provided prefix, it extracts the value, replacing the `begin` prefix from the key and adjusts the value according to its type (boolean, null, or number). If the value doesn't belong to any of these predefined types, the raw value is taken. Finally, it returns the resulting object casted to `T` type.

The `useSearchState` hook is built upon the `useSearchParams` hook and manages the search state object in the URL. It initializes its state using `useSearchParams`, manages its state with the `useState` hook, and updates and cleans the search state when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts using the `useEffect` hook.

These hooks are designed to help manage search parameters in the URL, which may be useful when you want to share links to specific states of an application or preserve application state across refreshes in a way that's native to the web.

# useSearchState

The `useSearchState` hook is a custom React Hook that manages the search state in a URL. It takes a `defaultValues` argument, which specifies the default values for the search state object. This argument can be an object or a function that returns one. Additionally, it receives a second argument that defines the configuration for the search state's behavior.

Inside the hook, `useState` is initially used with the `useSearchParams` hook and defaultValues to set the initial state. The `useSearchParams` hook is not provided in the attached code, but it's likely a hook that extracts and returns search parameters from the URL.

Two `useEffect` hooks are used. The first one runs when the `state` variable changes. Each time this happens, it dispatches an "update" action using the `dispatchState` function. This behavior ensures that state changes are synchronized with the URL search parameters.

The second `useEffect` runs only when the component is unmounted (its return function serves as the cleanup function), and it dispatches a "unmount" action using the `dispatchState` function. This is primarily a cleanup operation - it removes the search parameters from the URL when the component using this hook is unmounted.

`dispatchState` is a function responsible for two tasks:
1. "update": It updates the URL's search parameters according to the current state and configuration.
2. "unmount": It cleans up the search parameters in the URL when the component unmounts.

The hook returns the current state and a function to update the state (`setState`) as a constant array, making it available for usage in the consuming component. The specific behavior of `useSearchState` (like managing the search parameters in the URL, delay timing for updates, and cleanup strategy) is highly dependent on the behavior of `dispatchState`, `useSearchParams` functions, and the `ISearchStateConfig` interface.

# useSinglerunAction

The "useSinglerunAction" is a custom React hook designed to handle asynchronous actions and their associated loading and error states. It takes two generic parameters, Data and Payload, which represent the type of data returned by the asynchronous action and the type of payload accepted by it, respectively.

This hook accepts two arguments: "run", which is the asynchronous action to be executed, and "options" that includes additional configurations for the hook. The "run" function is expected to take a payload and return either Data or a Promise of Data.

The "options" parameter can have four properties:
1. "onLoadStart": A callback executed when the asynchronous action starts.
2. "onLoadEnd": A callback executed when the asynchronous action ends.
3. "fallback": A callback executed when an error occurs if "throwError" is set to false.
4. "throwError": A flag used to determine whether to throw an error or call the "fallback" function when an error occurs. By default, this is set to true.

The hook uses several other hooks and utilities in its implementation, such as "useState" to maintain both the loading and error states of the asynchronous operation, "useRef" to track the mount status of the component using this hook, "useActualCallback", and "singlerun".

"useLayoutEffect" is used to change the "isMounted" variable to false when the component unmounts, preventing any state updates after unmounting. "useMemo" is employed to define "execute", a memoized function that runs the provided "run" function with safe guards for loading state, error handling, and unmounted component state updates.

The hook finally returns an object containing "loading", "error", and "execute".

# useSingleton

The `useSingleton` hook in React ensures that a specific value is only instantiated once within the lifetime of a React component. This is useful when you want to prevent the function from creating a new instance of the value on each render. The hook accepts a generic type `T` or a function that returns a value of type `T`. 

Inside the hook, `useCallback` is used to ensure that the `resolve` function does not change between renders. The `resolve` function checks if the provided value is a function or not. If it's a function, the return value is used; otherwise, the provided value itself is used.

`useRef` is then used to hold the provided value or the result from the function call. `useRef` provides a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument `EMPTY_VALUE`.

The `EMPTY_VALUE` constant, defined with a unique `Symbol`, is used as an identifier to mark uninitialized or empty states for `useRef`.

The hook checks whether `resultRef.current` is still holding the initial `EMPTY_VALUE`. If so, the `resolve()` function is called to obtain the instance of the value and this instance is stored in `resultRef.current`, which is then returned by the `useSingleton` hook.

For subsequent calls to `useSingleton`, as long as the component doesn't unmount, `resultRef.current` won't be `EMPTY_VALUE`, and hence the `resolve` won't be called again, ensuring that the same instance of `T` is used across multiple renders.

This pattern allows you to create a singleton object in a React component, which can be handy when the creation of the object is expensive.

# useSource

The `useSource` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to work with observable data sources of type `TObserver<Data>`. It takes a single parameter, `target`, which can be either an instance of `TObserver<Data>` or a function that returns such an instance. The `Data` type parameter provides flexibility, enabling the hook to work with any observable data source type.

The hook utilizes two other React hooks: `useEffect` and `useMemo`. The `useEffect` hook is used to create side effects in functional components, and its cleanup function is used to unsubscribe from the `TObserver<Data>` value when certain conditions are met. The `useMemo` hook returns a memoized value that only updates if one of its dependencies changes, which is useful for expensive calculations.

Additionally, the `useSingleton` hook (possibly another custom hook) is used to obtain the singleton instance of the target observable data source.

In summary, the `useSource` hook allows you to subscribe and unsubscribe from an observable data source, returning a shared value from the data source. Whenever the target changes, the hook ensures that you unsubscribe from the old data source. This hook and its internal logic are crucial for managing data flow in a React application, especially when dealing with observable data sources.

# useSubject

The `useSubject` hook is a versatile function that allows you to create and manage a reactive subject in your React application. It can be customized for any data type and takes an optional target as a parameter, which can be either an instance of `TSubject<Data>` or null. This target represents an existing reactive subject that the new subject can subscribe to.

To create a single instance of the `Subject<Data>` class, you can use the `useSingleton` hook, ensuring that every render uses the same instance and avoids creating a new one unnecessarily.

The `useEffect` hook is then used to perform side effects in the React component. Within `useEffect`, it checks if a target subject exists and, if so, subscribes the `result` subject to it. This ensures that the `result` subject will receive updates from the target subject.

The `useEffect` hook also defines a variable called `dtor`, which will hold the return value (destructor) of the `subscribe` function from the target subject. This allows for proper cleanup when the component unmounts, as the `dtor` function will be called to unsubscribe from the subject.

In summary, `useSubject` is a hook that creates and manages a reactive subject in React, optionally subscribing it to an existing subject, and maintains the same instance across renders of the consuming component.

# useSubjectValue

The `useSubjectValue` is a React hook function that allows you to create a state variable which is synchronized with an observable subject. It takes in a target `observableSubject` and an optional initial value or function to set the state variable. The hook uses `useState` to declare a state variable (`data`) and `useEffect` to subscribe to updates from the target observable subject. The `useEffect` function runs whenever the target observable subject changes, and updates the state variable with new values emitted by the subject. The function returns the state variable, allowing you to easily access and use the synced value in your React components.

# useSubscription

The `useSubscription` hook is a function that takes another function, `fn`, as an argument. This `fn` function returns a non-returning (void) function. The purpose of `useSubscription` is to utilize the `useEffect` hook provided by React, which allows you to access and manipulate React state and lifecycle features from functional components.

Inside `useSubscription`, the `fn` function is used to return a non-returning (void) function. This returned function is then used within `useEffect`. The `useEffect` hook accepts two arguments: a function and an array. The first argument is the function that performs side effects, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation. The second argument is an array of dependencies for the effect. Since this array is empty (`[]`), the effect will only run once, similar to `componentDidMount` in class components.

By using `useSubscription`, you can emulate a `componentDidMount` effect that runs a subscribe function (which returns an unsubscribe function) when the component mounts. When the component unmounts, the returned unsubscribe function will be called to clean up the subscription. However, without seeing how `useSubscription` is actually used, this explanation should be considered an educated guess.

# useTime

The `useTime` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to use a time picker with modal functionality. It creates a mutable ref object using `useRef` to store a function that will be called when the time is changed. The hook also uses a helper function called `useModal` to manage the modal functionality.

When you call `useTime`, it returns a function that shows the modal when called and provides a `then()` function for setting the function to be called when the time is changed. It also has a `toPromise()` method for easy use with async/await syntax.

This hook utilizes React Hooks, custom hooks like `useModal`, JavaScript Promises for async handling, anonymous classes in JavaScript, higher-order functions, and React JSX for creating components using an HTML-like syntax. If you have any further questions, please let me know.

# useUserAgent

The `useUserAgent` hook is a custom React function that utilizes the `useMemo` hook to provide information based on the user agent string provided by a client's browser. It is primarily used to determine if the client is using an Apple Mobile device, such as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod. The hook returns an object containing a single property, `isAppleMobile`, which is a boolean value that returns `true` if the user agent string contains "iPad", "iPhone", or "iPod". This hook is useful for easily determining if the client's device is an Apple mobile device.

# useWatchChanges

The `useWatchChanges` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to detect changes in a set of dependencies and trigger actions when those dependencies are modified. It takes an array of dependencies (`deps`) as its argument and returns an object containing methods and properties to watch for and react to changes in those dependencies.

Under the hood, `useWatchChanges` uses another custom hook called `useSubject`. This hook creates an instance of the `Subject` class, which is an implementation of the Observer pattern. This instance (`changeSubject`) is used for broadcasting notifications about changes.

The `useChange` hook is invoked with a callback that triggers the `next()` function of `changeSubject`, effectively signaling that a change has occurred in the watched dependencies.

The returned object also contains a custom hook called `useChanges` that is designed to be used within functional React components. This hook ultimately subscribes to `changeSubject`, setting up the component to respond whenever `changeSubject` emits. The response is a state change, which will cause the component to re-render.

In summary, this code sets up a system that will cause a state change (and thus a re-render) in components that are using the `useChanges` hook whenever dependencies managed by the respective `useWatchChanges` instance are changed.

# useWindowSize

The `useWindowSize` hook is a React function that allows components to dynamically adjust their size based on the window's dimensions. It listens for changes in the window size and responds accordingly. The hook takes an optional parameter object that defines the debounce delay for resize events and a function to compute the size. It also includes an optional callback function that is invoked when the window size changes.

The hook initializes a state variable to store the current window size. It uses `useEffect` to add a resize event listener on the window, updating the state with the new size whenever a resize event occurs. If the new size is different from the current state, it updates the state and calls the optional `onResize` callback.

The hook can be used in conjunction with the `IActionModalProps` interface to dynamically adjust the height and width of action modals based on window size. The `LARGE_SIZE_REQUEST` and `SMALL_SIZE_REQUEST` constants are used to define specific sizing preferences, reducing or hardcoding height and width attributes respectively.

Overall, the `useWindowSize` hook allows for responsive adjustments to interface components based on window size changes, providing a more user-friendly experience across different screen sizes.

# useOpenDocument

The `useOpenDocument` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to display a document preview in a modal window. It accepts an optional parameter `options` of type `IParams`, which provides customization options for the document preview. These include callback functions to handle events like loading, mounting, unmounting, submitting, and closing the component. You can also customize the label and title of the component.

The hook uses another custom hook called `useActualRef` to store a mutable reference to the current request for the document. It then utilizes another existing hook called `useOutletModal` to generate a render function and a pickData function for the document preview modal. The options provided to `useOutletModal` are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the modal.

Finally, the hook returns an object containing a `render` function and a `pickData` function. The `render` function is used to render the document preview component, while the `pickData` function sets the parameters of the given request and redirects to the home page, handling data from the given request URL.

# usePreventAction

The `usePreventAction` hook is a custom React Hook designed to manage the loading state and execute specific functions when the loading starts or ends. It takes an object of parameters as its argument, which includes optional properties for handling the start of loading, end of loading, and a state to disable the action. The hook initializes a state variable called `loading` to keep track of the loading status. It returns an object that includes functions for handling the start and end of loading, as well as a boolean value representing the current loading state. This hook is particularly useful for actions that take time to execute, such as fetching data from a server, and allows other parts of the app to know when such an action is ongoing or completed.

# useActionModal

The `useActionModal` is a custom React Hook designed to manage an action modal in a hypothetical application's user interface. It abstracts the state management and rendering logic for an action modal, making it easier to implement and customize. The hook accepts an object containing various parameters and configuration options for the action modal. It also utilizes generic functions to ensure type safety. The hook uses React's `useState` to manage local state, such as whether the modal is open and a parameter. It also employs `useEffect` to update the parameter if a specific value changes. The hook creates memoized versions of a `handleSubmit` function and a rendering function named `render`, using React's `useCallback`. The render function returns an `ActionModal` component that utilizes the state and callback functions maintained by the hook. Overall, `useActionModal` simplifies the process of implementing and customizing an action modal in a React application by handling the complexities of state management and rendering.

# usePreventNavigate

The `usePreventNavigate` hook is a React component tool that helps prevent users from navigating away from a page and prompts them for confirmation if needed. It's particularly useful in forms or other areas where user inputs need to be preserved. The hook takes parameters like `history` (from react-router-dom), `withConfirm` (for confirmation prompt), and `onLoadStart`/`onLoadEnd` (callback functions for loading state). It uses `useState` and `useRef` to manage internal state, displays a confirmation dialog with `useConfirm` hook, and uses `useEffect` to create navigation blockers. The hook returns methods and a state, allowing consumers to control loading phases, block/unblock navigation, and check loading state. It assumes the `history` module from react-router-dom is available and follows the Rules of Hooks.

# useCursorPaginator

The `useCursorPaginator` is a React Hook that assists in implementing cursor-based pagination systems. It is particularly useful in scenarios where infinite scrolling or progressively loading content is required. The hook comes with a generic type parameter `Data` which allows you to specify the data type being worked with, or it defaults to `RowData`.

To use the hook, you pass an object of type `IParams` as an argument, which contains various fields representing the input parameters that configure the paginator. The `reloadSubject`, `initialData`, `handler`, `delay`, and `limit` variables are then destructured from the `params`. These parameters have default values, so if they are not provided during the function call, they will take their default values.

The hook uses the `useSubject`, `useActualState`, and `useActualCallback` hooks to manage state and capture context. It also uses `useQueuedAction` and `useSingleRunAction` to manage different types of asynchronous actions.

The `fetchData` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves more data using the `handler$` provided when calling `useCursorPaginator`. The `onSkip` function is also asynchronous and is used to load the next set of data by calling `fetchData`.

The hook uses `useEffect` to handle the `reloadSubject`. Whenever `reloadSubject` is triggered, `fetchData`, and `onSkip` are cleared, and the initial data is set to an empty array.

To optimize performance, `useMemo` and `useCallback` are used to avoid unnecessary re-renders and computations.

Finally, the `useCursorPaginator` function returns an object that contains the paginator data and related functions such as `setData`, `onSkip` etc., which can be used in the component for pagination.

# useGridAction

The `useGridAction` is a React hook that allows you to handle actions on data grids. It provides functionality for both generic grid actions and specific row actions. To use this hook, you need to pass an object of type `IParams<Data>` that defines various properties for performing actions, handling errors, and setting fallback behavior.

Some key properties of the `IParams<Data>` object include:
- `fetchRow`: This function fetches a specific row from the grid based on its `id`.
- `onAction`: This function is executed when a grid action occurs. It receives the name of the action, the rows to perform the action on, and a function to deselect all rows.
- `onRowAction`: This function is executed when a row action occurs.

The `useGridAction` hook also uses two other hooks: `useGridSelection` and `useAsyncAction`. The former is responsible for managing row selection in the grid, providing `deselectAll`, `gridProps`, and `selectedRows`. The latter is used twice: once to commit actions on the selected rows of the entire grid (`commitAction`) and once to commit actions on a single specified row (`commitRowAction`).

Ultimately, the `useGridAction` hook returns an object with five properties: `deselectAll`, `commitAction`, `commitRowAction`, `selectedRows`, and `gridProps`. These properties are used to interact with the grid system, manage selection, and commit actions on the grid or individual rows.

# useGridSelection

The `useGridSelection` hook is a custom React Hook designed to manage row selection in grid-like structures. It utilizes React Hooks, which allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. The hook creates a state variable, `selectedRows`, which is an array of string IDs representing the selected rows. It also provides a memoized `deselectAll` function that sets the `selectedRows` to an empty array. The hook returns an object containing the state, grid selection properties (including a function to set the selected rows), and a deselect all function. This hook can be used in a component to easily manage the state of row selection in a grid, where rows are selected for operations specified in the `IParams` interface.

# useOffsetPaginator

The `useOffsetPaginator` is a custom React Hook that enhances standard pagination systems by adding features like loading state, error handling, and additional query properties to handle complex data fetching scenarios. It divides a large set of data into smaller pages for improved efficiency and performance. The hook uses generics to define a type for the single unit of data and accepts an object with parameters that configure the pagination mechanism. It manages multiple states, including the initial data and component state. The hook fetches data from a source using the `execute: fetchData` function from the `useQueuedAction` hook. It also handles skip events and reload logic using the `execute: onSkip` function from the `useSinglerunAction` hook. The hook returns an object containing the paginated data, utility functions, and flags indicating the loading status and error presence. This allows for building a UI that reflects the current loading state and error status of pagination.

# useApiPaginator

The `useApiPaginator` is a TypeScript function that serves as a list handler generator for efficiently fetching and processing data from an API endpoint with pagination capabilities. It offers a wide range of options to customize the data fetching process and provides features like filters, pagination, sorting, search, and chips.

The function `useApiPaginator` is a generic function that takes two parameters: `path` (the API endpoint) and an optional `settings` object. The generic parameters `FilterData` and `RowData`, which extend from the `IAnything` interface, are used to specify the type of filter data and row data.

The function provides default values for several settings, such as using `window.fetch` for the fetch operation, and `window.location.origin` for the origin, among others. Default functions are also provided for manipulating the request and response, handling filters, chips, sorting, search, and pagination.

The returned function `handler` takes parameters for filter data, pagination, sorting, chips, and search. It returns a result that includes the filtered, sorted, and paginated data. The function leverages the provided functions for manipulating these parameters and processing the response. It handles errors during fetch requests or manual aborts appropriately.

After defining the list handler, `useEffect` is used to clean up after the component is unmounted. This includes cancelling any pending network requests and clearing the fetch queue.

The `useApiPaginator` function is highly customizable, allowing for various options to change its behavior. This pattern is often useful in libraries or utility functions where a single function needs to support multiple scenarios with numerous options.

The function's comments are well-documented, providing clear explanations of the expected parameters and their default behaviors. This serves as a great example of how to document complex functions.

# useArrayPaginator

The `useArrayPaginator` hook is a powerful tool for handling and manipulating data arrays in React applications. It allows you to paginate, filter, search, sort, and apply other functionalities to your data with ease.

This hook is defined as a generic function, taking two type parameters: `FilterData` and `RowData`. The former dictates the object type for filter data, while the latter represents the row data objects and extends the `IRowData` interface.

To use `useArrayPaginator`, you need to pass a function, `ListHandler<FilterData, RowData>`, which retrieves the row data. Additionally, you can provide an options object to configure the hook's behavior. This options object contains properties for various functionalities, such as search entries, search filter characters, response map, remove empty filters, compare function, filter handler, chips handler, sort handler, search handler, pagination handler, and flags for enabling or disabling functionalities like filters, chips, sorting, pagination, and more.

The hook returns `ListHandler<FilterData, RowData>` and includes a nested function that queues the resolve function and returns its result asynchronously. This ensures that expensive calculations are only re-run when necessary, thanks to the use of `useMemo` for performance optimization.

In summary, `useArrayPaginator` is a versatile and efficient tool for managing data arrays in React applications, providing a wide range of controls and options for operations like searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

# useCachedPaginator

useCachedPaginator is a TypeScript hook function that creates a customizable cached paginator for list data. It's particularly useful in frontend scenarios where there are long and chunky lists of data that need to be requested from the backend server in an optimized manner.

The function is generic and takes two type parameters, FilterData and RowData. These represent the type of filter data and the type of data in each row, respectively. If not provided, they default to IAnything.

The function accepts two arguments: 
1. handler of type ListHandler<FilterData, RowData>: This could be an Array of type RowData or a function that returns Promise<ListHandlerResult<RowData>> or ListHandlerResult<RowData>. The function handles list actions like filtering, pagination, sorting, and searching data.
2. params of type IArrayPaginatorParams<FilterData, RowData>: This parameters object is used to customize the paginator's behavior. It includes handlers for filtering, sorting, and pagination of data rows, a response mapper, a search handler, a compare function for manual sorting, data validation rules, several true/false switches for turning on/off built-in features, and handlers for fallbacks and load statuses.

The function uses useMemo hook from React library to memoize a function rowsHandler. This function encapsulates the handler passed to useCachedPaginator. If the handler is a function, it's invoked with the arguments passed to rowsHandler. If it's an object (a predefined list of RowData), it's returned as it is. useMemo ensures that rowsHandler is only created once and not re-created on every render, unless its dependencies change.

The return statement outputs an object with two properties: handler and clear.
1. handler is obtained by invoking useArrayPaginator with rowsHandler and params. So this handler is essentially an array paginator handler targeted at the RowData list (precomputed or dynamic).
2. clear is a reference to the clear function in rowsHandler. This could be used to clear the cached list data.

The returned result is of type IResult<FilterData, RowData> which represents the result of a ListHandler operation. This interface exposes handler and clear methods for handling the created paginator and clearing it.

In essence, useCachedPaginator creates fully customizable cached paginators using a combination of different handlers for different list actions and encapsulating them within a ListHandler object. It provides an elegant way to use caching and state management for data handlers, particularly useful when dealing with intensive data operations in frontend interfaces.

# useHistoryStatePagination

The `useHistoryStatePagination` hook is a custom React Hook designed to manage pagination states using the browser history state provided by `react-router`. It is a generic function that can be used with different data sets and types for custom filter data and row data. The hook takes two type parameters, `FilterData` and `RowData`, with both defaulting to `IAnything`.

The hook function accepts two main arguments: `history`, the history object from react-router, and `options`, an optional object containing configurations for the pagination. It initializes a state `state` derived from default query parameters and the current browser history location state. The `defaultQuery` is composed of a variety of default parameters, either coming from `initialValue` which is destructured from `options`, or default properties defined in `DEFAULT_QUERY`.

The hook uses several hooks, such as `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useState`, and `useEffect` to manage the query data state and handle changes in that state. It also listens for any change in the browser history location and updates the `state` based on the new location state, triggering an `onChange` event handler with the updated state.

The hook returns an object that includes `listProps` and the methods to get and set the various properties of `listProps`. It also provides specific callback functions, such as `onFilterChange` and `onLimitChange`, to handle state changes for specific parts of the query. When these functions are invoked, they update the relevant property in `state` and the browser history, triggering a re-render with the updated state. The full code includes similar callback functions to handle changes to other properties of the query.

This hook would be particularly useful in a scenario where you are displaying paginated data and want to maintain the current page, sort model, applied filters, etc., across page refreshes or navigation using browser history.

# useLastPagination

The `useLastPagination` hook is a custom React function designed to handle and manage pagination state and logic in an application. It is a generic function that can work with any type of filter data and row data. This hook receives a `ListHandler` function as an argument, which is expected to fetch data based on filter data and other parameters. The `ListHandler` function takes various parameters for data filtering, pagination, sorting, chips, and search. The hook uses React's `useState` to manage its internal state, which includes `filterData`, `chipData`, pagination data, sorting data, and search string. The hook defines a `handler` function that manipulates the internal state based on the arguments it receives. The `removeEmptyFilters` function is used to clean the filter data before setting it in the state. The hook returns an object containing the `handler` function and the current state data, allowing consumers to manipulate the state and react to changes. In a typical use case, this hook would be used by a component rendering paginated data, using the returned `handler` function to fetch new pages of data and render it based on the current state.

# useListAction

The `useListAction` function is a custom React hook that allows you to manage actions related to a list of data. It takes an object parameter with various properties that define different actions you can perform on the list. These properties include `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `throwError`, `fallback`, `fetchRow`, `onAction`, and `onRowAction`. The hook also uses another custom hook called `useListSelection` to manage the selection of data rows in a list.

The hook returns an object containing several functions and properties. The `deselectAll` function allows you to deselect all rows in the list. The `selectedRows` property contains an array of the currently selected rows. The `listProps` property contains the necessary props for rendering the list. The `commitAction` function asynchronously executes the `onAction` callback for all selected rows, along with the `deselectAll` callback. The `commitRowAction` function asynchronously executes the `onRowAction` callback for a specific row, along with the `deselectAll` callback.

This custom hook is designed to be used in a React environment and likely relies on React's state and effect hooks in its implementation. It encapsulates the functionality related to managing list actions such as loading, performing an action on selected rows, and performing an action on a single row.

# useListSelection

The `useListSelection` hook is used to manage the selection of rows in a list. It returns an object containing the `selectedRows` array, which holds the IDs of selected rows, and `listProps`, which includes the `selectedRows` array and a function to select row IDs. The hook also provides a `deselectAll` function to clear all row selections.

The `useListAction` hook provides a set of actions and hooks for managing a list of data based on the provided parameters. It can handle bulk actions and row-specific actions, with the option to provide custom `onAction` and `onRowAction` functions.

The `commitAction` and `commitRowAction` functions are obtained from the `useAsyncAction` hook and are used to perform actions on multiple rows or a single row, respectively. `useAsyncAction` is a custom hook that handles common states and side effects of asynchronous operations, such as loading state and error handling.

# useQueryPagination

The `useQueryPagination` hook is designed to handle paginated data fetching operations in a React application. It accepts two type parameters, `FilterData` and `RowData`, which provide types for variables and returned object types. The hook function takes in two optional parameters, `initialValue` and `options`, both with default values.

The hook uses React's `useState` and `useMemo` hooks to manage local state and create a memoized value for the default query object and state. It also includes several optional callback functions, such as `onFilterChange`, `onLimitChange`, `onPageChange`, `onSortModelChange`, `onChipsChange`, and `onSearchChange`. These callback functions are invoked when there is a change in their corresponding fields.

The hook also utilizes two custom hooks, `useChange` and `useActualValue`, which are not provided by React itself. `useChange` is used to call a custom function whenever the state changes, and `useActualValue` is used to get the most recent state value.

Additionally, the hook includes an object called `getQueryMap`, which contains various getter functions used to extract specific properties from the query data. This allows for easy access to specific parts of the state. However, there are several unknown constants, hook functions, types, and interfaces used in the implementation that are not described in the provided code.

# useModalManager

The `useModalManager` function is a custom React hook that allows you to manage modals in your application. It returns an object `IResult` with four properties: `total`, which represents the number of modals in the stack, and three functions: `push`, `pop`, and `clear`. The hook uses the `useContext` function to access the ModalManagerContext, which is a context provider somewhere in the component tree. The `push` function adds a new modal to the stack, `pop` removes the last modal from the stack, and `clear` clears the entire modal stack. The `IResult` interface defines the object returned by this hook, with a `total` property of type number and three function properties: `push`, `pop`, and `clear`. These functions are annotated with JSDoc comments to provide brief descriptions of their purposes and behaviors.

# useModal

The `useModal` is a custom React Hook that simplifies the management of modal dialogs in a React application. It provides an easy way to control the visibility of a modal, as well as handle its content and interactions. The hook takes a `renderer` function as an argument, which returns the JSX component to be displayed when the modal is opened. It also takes an array of dependencies (`deps`) to trigger updates when any of them change.

The hook initializes a state variable `open` using the `useState` Hook, which determines whether the modal is visible or not. It also defines two callback operations, `showModal` and `hideModal`, which set the `open` state to true or false, respectively. These operations can be used to display and hide the modal.

The `useModal` hook returns an object containing the `showModal` and `hideModal` methods, making it easy to manage modals with different content throughout the application. It follows best practices by abstracting complex operations into a customizable and reusable hook.

# useApiHandler

The `useApiHandler` is a custom React hook that allows you to create reusable API handlers for performing asynchronous HTTP requests and processing responses. It takes an object configuration `IApiHandlerParams<Data>` that sets up various parameters and options for the API handler, such as origin, request and response parameters mapping, loading lifecycle hooks, abort signals, fetch parameters and fallback error handler.

The function provides default values for `fetch`, `origin`, `abortSignal`, `requestMap`, and `responseMap` that can be overridden by the user. The `fetch` function is the built-in window fetch API, `origin` is the current window's location origin, `abortSignal` is referenced from an abort manager, `requestMap` updates the request URL, and `responseMap` changes the JSON response.

The API handler `handler` inside the `useApiHandler` function is memoized using React's `useMemo` function, ensuring it only changes if any of its dependencies change. The handler makes an async request, calls `onLoadBegin` before making a request if present, processes the response, and then calls `onLoadEnd` after making a request if present. In case of any error, it checks if a fallback function is provided which handles errors, otherwise it throws the error.

Several `useEffect` hooks are used to handle cleaning up tasks when the component is unmounted or re-rendered. They provide aborting the request and clearing the queue when the component is unmounted.

The hook returns the `handler` which is expected to be a function that either returns data or performs asynchronous tasks with payload based on `OneHandler` type.

The hook also uses `useEffect` hooks to handle side effects, such as lifecycle methods in class components. It utilizes `abortManager` to manage aborting of requests and `queued` to control the execution of tasks in a queue. It also uses `FetchError` to handle fetch-related errors and `CANCELED_SYMBOL` to represent a canceled request.

Overall, `useApiHandler` provides a convenient way to handle asynchronous API requests and responses in a reusable manner within React applications.

# useLocalHandler

The `useLocalHandler` is a custom React Hook that fetches data using a provided handler function, and manages the data using React hooks. It introduces loading and error states, allowing for easy data transformation. The hook accepts a handler and an options object, providing flexibility in handling the data. The options object allows for customization such as data transformation, payload passing to the handler function, and callbacks for loading and error states. Inside the hook, a state is initialized using `useState` and the `useEffect` hook is used to asynchronously call the handler function. The state is managed based on the result or error obtained from the handler function. The hook returns an object containing the data obtained from the handler function and a `change` function to manipulate the data. Overall, this hook provides an abstraction for managing data fetching with loading, error, and success states, as well as data transformation.

# usePreventLeave

The `usePreventLeave` React hook is designed to prevent users from leaving a page without confirming if they want to discard any unsaved changes. This hook can be used with data of any type and is customizable through a provided `params` object.

The hook initializes various state and "ref" values using the `useState` and `useRef` hooks. It also utilizes the `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks to manage side-effects and synchronous DOM mutations, respectively.

The `handleLoadStart` and `handleLoadEnd` functions are used to increment and decrement a loading count, potentially representing different phases of a multi-phase load operation.

The `pickConfirm` function displays a customizable confirmation prompt to the user, asking if they want to leave the page without saving changes. The `handleNavigate` function handles navigation and, if necessary, prompts the user for confirmation before allowing them to leave.

The `createRouterSubject`, `createLayoutSubject`, and `createUnloadSubject` functions set up different subscriptions or event listeners to manage navigation and prevent the user from leaving without confirmation. The `unsubscribe` function cleans up these subscriptions and event listeners when necessary.

Overall, the `usePreventLeave` hook provides a way to manage data and prevent users from leaving a page without confirming if they want to discard unsaved changes.

# useStaticHandler

The `useStaticHandler` is a React hook that generates a static handler, which remains unchanged across multiple component rerenders. It takes an existing handler and provides optional custom behavior for result mapping, load start and end events, as well as error fallback procedures.

The hook accepts two type parameters, `Data` and `Payload`, with default values of the `IAnything` type. It also takes in two arguments: a handler function of type `OneHandler` and an options object of type `IStaticHandlerParams`. The options object allows for custom callbacks to modify the behavior of the static handler.

The `resultHandler` is the resulting static handler function. It first calls `onLoadBegin` (if provided), then attempts to resolve the original handler with a provided payload. The `resultMap` function is then applied to the result, and this final result is returned. If an error occurs in the handler, the `fallback` function (if provided) is executed, or else the error is re-thrown. After handling errors, `onLoadEnd` is called with a success status of false.

The `useMemo` hook from React is used to ensure that `resultHandler` is not recreated on every execution, but only when the dependencies change. In this case, an empty dependencies array is provided to ensure the memoized value never updates after the initial render, always returning the same handler function.

# useOutletModal

The `useOutletModal` hook is a custom React hook that manages the functionality of an "outlet modal" and provides necessary callbacks for interactivity. It is built with three generic types: `Data`, `Payload`, and `Params`. These types are used for type-checking the data being handled and passed around, with some defaults provided. The hook accepts various parameters that define its behavior, such as `fallback` content to be rendered if the modal cannot be displayed, `pathname` and `history` for managing navigation of the outlet modal, `fullScreen` for indicating whether the modal should be displayed in full screen, `onLoadEnd` and `onLoadStart` for callbacks when the outlet content starts and finishes loading, respectively, `throwError` for specifying if errors should be thrown during submission, `onChange` for a callback when the outlet content changes, `onSubmit` for a callback when the outlet content is submitted, `onMount` and `onUnmount` for callbacks when the outlet modal is mounted and unmounted, respectively, `onClose` for a callback when the outlet modal is closed, `submitLabel` for the label of the submit button in the outlet modal, `title` for the title of the outlet modal, and `hidden` for a boolean value indicating whether the outlet modal should be hidden.

The hook returns an object containing functions `render` and `pickData`, and signals `open` and `close` related to the modal state. This API is intended to be used for controlling the prompting, hiding, and data handling of the `OutletModal`. The hook uses multiple custom hooks such as `useSubject`, `useBehaviorSubject`, `useSingleton`, and `useActualCallback`. It also leverages React's `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks for managing side effects and memoizing functions and values.

The hook initializes subjects, `onSubmit` callback, outlet modal history, and other necessary values. It defines `handleSubmit` and `handleClose` functions using `useCallback`. The `handleSubmit` submits the outlet data and clears outlet ID if successful. The `handleClose` clears outlet ID and calls the provided `onClose` callback. It defines the `render` function, which returns the `OutletModal` component with bound props. It defines the `pickData` function that changes the `outletIdSubject`'s value, triggering associated subscriptions. It subscribes the `pickData` function to `pickDataSubject`'s changes using `useEffect`. Finally, it returns an object containing methods to open and close the modal, and the render function.

# useSearchModal

The `useSearchModal` is a custom React hook that provides functionality for using a search modal in your application. It takes in a configuration object that defines various parameters for controlling the search modal, and returns an object with properties and methods for interacting with the modal. The hook is dependent on Context API, `useState`, `useCallback`, and other React hooks.

The hook uses generics such as `FilterData`, `RowData`, `Payload`, and `Field` to type the various parameters accepted by the `useSearchModal` function. These generics default to `IAnything` and `IField` if not provided.

The configuration object includes properties like `param` (initial value for the parameter), `selectionMode` (handling selection within the search modal), `handler` (for handling events), and `fallback` (executed if an error occurs).

The hook also includes properties like `apiRef` (reference to the API), `reloadSubject` (for triggering reload events), and `payload` (initial preparation for the payload).

The hook provides callback functions for handling change events (`onChange`), action events (`onAction`), row action events (`onRowAction`), submit events (`onSubmit`), end of loading (`onLoadEnd`), and start of loading (`onLoadStart`).

Other properties include `submitLabel` (label for the submit button), `throwError` (indicating whether to throw an error or not), `title` (the title of the search modal), and `hidden` (indicating whether the search modal should be hidden or not).

The hook uses `useSingleton` and `useState` hooks to manage and sync state of payload and modal parameters between the parent and modal component.

An `useEffect` hook is used to watch changes in `upperParam`, so every time it changes, the local state `param` is updated.

The hook returns a JSX component `SearchModal` with all the necessary parameters, such as state and handlers for data submission, modal opening and closing, etc.

The `pickData` function is used to open the modal component and set a specific data parameter.

The hook returns an object that allows interaction with the modal, such as controlling its visibility (`open`), rendering it (`render`), choosing specific data parameter (`pickData`), and closing it (`close`).

# useTabsModal

The `useTabsModal` is a custom React hook that provides a modal component to display tabs with content and handles user interactions. It is designed to be highly configurable and manages the modal's open/closed state using reactive programming. The hook takes in an object of parameters that configure the modal's behavior, such as `onSubmit`, `onChange`, `onLoadStart`, `onLoadEnd`, `onMount`, `onUnmount`, and others. It uses several custom hooks like `useSingleton`, `useActualCallback`, and `useBehaviorSubject` to manage shared context/state behavior and side-effects for the submit action. The hook returns an object containing `open`, `render`, `pickData`, and `close` methods, which are used with the `TabsOutletModal` component to create a modal dialog with tabs for navigation.

# useWizardModal

The `useWizardModal` hook is a custom React hook designed to provide a modal component for wizards with various configurable parameters. It accepts a parameter object `params` that includes optional properties to control different aspects of the modal, such as whether it should be full-screen or set callbacks for different points in the wizard's lifecycle.

The hook declares several pieces of state and callbacks, including:
- `openSubject`: A reactive subject that maintains whether the modal is open or not, and allows emitting a new value to its subscribers using the `next` method.
- `history`: A state to keep track of navigation history inside the modal. If not passed as a parameter, it creates a new memory history object.
- `handleSubmit`: A callback to handle form submissions. Once the data is successfully submitted, it closes the modal.
- `handleClose`: A callback to handle the closing of the modal. It emits 'false' to `openSubject` and triggers the `onClose` callback if it exists.
- `render`: A callback to render a `WizardOutletModal` with all the desired props.
- `pickData`: A function that opens the modal.

The hook returns an object consisting of:
- `open`: A boolean value indicating whether the modal is open.
- `render`: A function used to render the wizard modal.
- `pickData`: A function for opening the modal.
- `close`: A function that closes the modal and triggers an empty payload submission.

The `useCallback` hooks are used to optimize performance by memoizing the callbacks, so they don't get recreated in each render, only when their dependencies change. Overall, the `useWizardModal` hook provides a flexible way to create and control a wizard-like modal and its lifecycle events, leveraging React hooks and RxJS for state management and callback handling.

# useOneProps

The `useOneProps` is a custom React hook designed to be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in FieldType.Component or custom slots. This hook allows you to access the context value from `PropsContext`. 

In simpler terms, `useOneProps` is a generic function that accepts an optional argument `Data`, which must be a subtype of the `IAnything` interface. It uses React's `useContext` hook to retrieve the context value from `PropsContext`. Finally, it asserts the type of the retrieved value to be `IOneProps<Data>`, providing TypeScript with the confidence to treat it as such. This hook can be used to access and utilize the properties of a more specific type within your React components.

# useOneState

The `useOneState` hook is a custom React Hook that can be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in FieldType.Component or custom slots. It is a generic function that takes `Data` as its type variable, allowing for reusability across different types. The `Data` type variable extends the `IAnything` interface, meaning it can be any type that is a subtype of `IAnything`.

The hook uses the `useContext` React Hook to access the current value of the `StateContext`. This value is then type-casted to be of type `IState<Data>`, which represents the state of the application. The `IState<Data>` interface has properties such as `object`, which holds the data of type `Data` or null, `setObject`, a function to set the data of type `Data`, `invalidMap` which is a map of strings to booleans, and `changeObject` which is a function that accepts data of type `Data`.

In summary, the `useOneState` hook allows access to the value of `StateContext` and ensures that it is of type `IState<Data>`, enabling the management and manipulation of state throughout your application.

# useOnePayload

The `useOnePayload` is a custom React hook that allows you to access the value of `PayloadContext` within a React component. It uses the built-in `useContext` hook to extract and return the current context value for `PayloadContext`. This hook is useful when you want to avoid passing props down manually at every level in a component tree that has a global state. The `PayloadContext` is created using React's `createContext` function and is designed to store a `payload` prop from the `IOneProps` interface, excluding `undefined`. The hook can be used in FieldType.Component, custom slot or custom field within `<One />` and `<List />` components.

# useOneFeatures

The `useOneFeatures` hook is a custom React Hook that allows you to access the values stored in the `FeatureContext` within components like `FieldType.Component`, custom slots, or custom fields within `<One />` and `<List />` components. The `FeatureContext` is a Context API object created using `createContext` from React, which provides and consumes state throughout the component tree without prop drilling. You can use the built-in `useContext()` hook to obtain the value from `FeatureContext`.

The `ComponentField` is a functional component that accepts various properties related to component fields. Some of these properties have default values, allowing for custom configuration options. The component uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. `useState` is used to declare a stateful value and function to update it (`node` and `setNode`), while `useEffect` is used to perform side effect operations. The component sets the node to either a `ComponentInstance` or an `Element`, with the latter defaulting to a `Fragment` if not provided.

The code also makes use of other custom hooks, such as `useOneState` and `useOnePayload`, which provide access to other context objects. Additionally, the `useStyles` hook is used to get styles for the component, utilizing Material-UI's `makeStyles` to generate a hook function (named `useStyles` here) that provides CSS classes for styling purposes.

Overall, this code defines a Component Field in a form-like interface, leveraging TypeScript for static type checking and ensuring that passed properties are valid according to predefined interfaces. It relies on React's Context API for efficient state and prop management, avoiding the need to manually pass props down at every level.

# useOneRadio

The `useOneRadio` hook is a custom React hook designed to be used within the `<One />` and `<List />` components, or in custom slot and field within the FieldType.Component. It provides a state for the `Radio` components, allowing their states to be shared and synced. The hook is created using the `createStateProvider` function, which returns both the `RadioProvider` and `useOneRadio`. The `RadioProvider` is a context provider that should be used to wrap components where the radio component states are utilized. On the other hand, `useOneRadio` retrieves the current state of the radio components.

The `Radio` component has properties defined by the `IRadioSlot` interface, which includes both the `IRadioFieldProps` and `IRadioFieldPrivate`. These interfaces enforce certain properties within the radio component. The `useActualValue` hook is used to get the current value of `radioMap`, which should return the latest value of `radioMap` during the render phase. The `setValue` function updates a specific radio button's value in the `radioMap` using the `setRadioMap` function, and it is memoized with the `useCallback` hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

The `handleChange` function is a helper function that sets the radio group's value and triggers the `onChange` event. The `useEffect` hook keeps track of the changes made to the `value` prop and updates the value in the `radioMap` to keep them synchronized. The returned JSX in the `Radio` component describes how the radio button should be rendered in the React component tree, using a `FormGroup`, `RadioGroup`, `FormControlLabel`, and the material design radio button component `MatRadio`. The response to the change in the radio button's state is handled by the `onChange` prop.

# useOneContext

The `useOneContext` hook is designed to be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in FieldType.Component, custom slots or custom fields. This hook allows you to access the value of a context created using `createContext` from React. 

When you call `useOneContext()`, it will return the value of `OneContext` if it is valid (non-null or non-undefined). If the context is not provided, it will return `DEFAULT_VALUE`, which is an empty object.

In the `ComponentInstance` function, the `useOneContext()` hook is used to assign the value of `OneContext` to the variable `context`. This value is then passed as a prop to the `Element` component. The `ComponentFieldInstanceProps` type is used to define the props for `ComponentInstance`, and the `Omit` utility type is used to exclude the `context` property from the `ComponentFieldInstance`.

# useOneMenu

The `useOneMenu` hook is designed to simplify the usage of `useContext` with the `MenuContext`. It can be used in various components like `FieldType.Component`, custom slots, or custom fields within `<One />` and `<List />`. This hook provides a convenient way to access the state of `MenuContext` without having to directly use the `useContext` hook.

The interface `IContext` contains two properties:
1. `createContextMenu` - This is a method that accepts parameters of type `IParams` and returns a `React.MouseEventHandler` for an HTMLDivElement. It is used to create a context menu and handle its events.
2. `requestSubject` - This is a generic property of type `TSubject` initialized with `void`. It is used to request a subject related to the context menu.

Without more information about `TSubject` and `IParams`, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation of their roles. However, these properties hold contextual values or methods that are essential for the application relying on this `MenuContext`.

# useListProps

The "useProps" hook is a custom React hook designed to retrieve and return the current props from a React context called "PropContext". This hook can be used within FieldType.Component, custom slots or custom fields within the <One /> and <List /> components.

The "PropContext" is a context object that stores the properties of a component and allows them to be passed down the component tree without having to manually pass props at every level. The hook uses the "useContext" function to retrieve the current context value.

The "useProps" function is defined with four generic parameters: FilterData, RowData, Payload, and Field. These generics define the structure of the context and have default types. The "useContext" hook is invoked with the "PropContext", and the returned value is type-casted as "IPropContext<FilterData, RowData, Payload, Field>".

The "IPropContext" interface represents the structure of the properties being stored in the context and is defined with the same generics as the "useProps" function. The interface includes multiple definitions imported and used in defining the component properties, such as "IListProps", "IListState", and "IListCallbacks".

In summary, the "useProps" hook allows for obtaining properties from the "PropContext" context in a type-safe manner, specified by the generics FilterData, RowData, Payload, and Field.

# useListCachedRows

The `useListCachedRows` hook is a custom React hook designed to be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in FieldType.Component and custom slots. It returns the current context value for the `CachedRowsContext` context, which is used to store the state for cached rows of data in an application.

This hook utilizes the TypeScript generic `RowData`, which extends from the `IRowData` type and defaults to the `IAnything` type if not provided. It uses the `useContext` hook from React to subscribe to the `CachedRowsContext` context and read its state. The result is then cast to the `IState<RowData>` type, which represents the state of cached rows.

The `IState` interface has two properties: `cachedRows`, which is a `Map` where keys are of the `RowId` type and values are of generic `RowData` type, and `selectedRows`, which is an array of generic `RowData`. This hook allows developers to easily access and manipulate the cached rows data within their components, making it easier to work with and manage large datasets in their applications.

# useListPayload

The `useListPayload` hook is designed to be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in custom slots or FieldType.Component. This hook allows you to retrieve the current context value from `PayloadContext`. By exporting it as `export const usePayload`, you can easily access and utilize the payload from `PayloadContext` in other parts of your codebase. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to manage shared state or behavior in a React application, leveraging the capabilities of context and React hooks.

# useListChips

The `useListChips` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to manage and render a list of chips within the `<One />` and `<List />` components. It retrieves the `ChipsContext` value using the `useContext` hook, which should store and manage the state of chips. The `ChipsContext` is created using the `createContext` function, and it has a state interface `IState` that consists of a Map called `chips`, where chip names are keys and booleans indicating whether a chip is enabled or not are values, and a function `setChips` for updating the chips Map.

The `ModernChipListSlot` and `ClassicChipListSlot` components are used to render the list of chips, using different Material-UI components for the chip representation. They receive a list of chips and a loading flag as props, and they use the `useChips` and `useProps` hooks to access the chips state and additional properties. The chips are rendered dynamically with the `renderChip` function, and a handler for toggling the state of the chip is attached to its click event.

The `useStyles` function is used to create styles for these components using Material-UI's `makeStyles` function. Several interfaces are defined to describe the structure of various pieces of data in this system, such as a chip (`IListChip`), the chip state (`IState`), and a slot for chips (`IChipListSlot`). These interfaces are used as generic parameters and props to ensure type safety and guide the usage of the functions and components in this code.

# useListReload

The `useListReload` hook is a custom React hook designed to be used within `<One />` and `<List />` components, as well as in FieldType.Component or custom slots. It allows you to define a reusable piece of stateful logic for data reloading between different components.

The `useReload` function defines this custom hook and returns a callback function. Inside the `useReload` function, it calls another custom hook called `useProps` from an imported module. The `useProps` hook returns an object with a property called `handleReload`. The `useReload` function then extracts the `handleReload` function from `useProps`.

The returned callback function takes an optional boolean argument called `keepPagination`. When invoked, it calls the `handleReload(keepPagination)` function, which reloads the data. The `keepPagination` argument determines whether the current pagination should be preserved during data reloading.

This hook can be used in any part of your code where you need to reload data, possibly with an option to keep the current pagination. It can be utilized in FieldType.Component, custom slots or within `<One />` and `<List />` components.

# useListSelectionState

The `useListSelectionState` hook is a custom React hook designed to provide access to the current selection state stored in the `SelectionContext` within components like FieldType.Component, custom slots or fields within `<One />` and `<List />` components. This hook allows developers to access the context value from `SelectionContext` without having to wrap their component in a Context.Consumer in the JSX code, using `useContext` hook instead.

The `SelectionContext` is created using `React.createContext`, and it is expected to hold the current selection state. The `useSelection` hook utilizes the `useContext` hook to access this context value. The `IState` interface describes the selection state, which includes a set of `RowId`s representing the unique identifiers for rows in a table, and a `setSelection` function that updates the selection state.

The `RowId` type can be either a string or number. By using this hook, developers can access the current state of `SelectionContext` (which includes both the current selection state and a function to change this state) from anywhere within the component tree, as long as the component is a child of a Provider for this context.
