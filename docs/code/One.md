A React component named `One` is a wrapper around the more detailed `OneGenesis` component. It facilitates the creation of dynamic forms by providing a convenient interface and handling various events.

Callback aliases in the code are a way of ensuring that default callback functions are used when corresponding callbacks are not provided in the `props` object. They provide a clean and consistent way to handle default behaviors in the absence of explicit callback implementations.
