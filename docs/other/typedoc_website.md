You can browse that documentation website by [following the link](https://react-declarative-typedoc.github.io/)

## Purpose

The GPT-4 models adopted to feed additional data from the search engines with automatic hallucination filters. While the context window is not full, the net being asked to answer `TRUE` if `2 + 2 = 4`. If the output is not equal to true, the net is hallucinating and the current google link is rolling back. The cursor mooving to the next link
