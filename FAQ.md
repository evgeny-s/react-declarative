4.  **Declarative Scaffold Component**:
    
    *   The `<Scaffold2 />` component implements the basic Material Design visual layout structure using configuration instead of manual UI element composition.
    *   Example options for the scaffold:
        ```tsx
        const options = [
            {
                id: 'build',
                label: 'Build',
                children: [
                    {
                        id: 'authentication',
                        label: 'Authentication',
                        isVisible: async () => await ioc.authService.hasRole('unauthorized'),
                        icon: PeopleIcon,
                        tabs: [
                            { id: 'tab1', label: 'Tab1 in header' },
                            { id: 'tab2', label: 'Tab2 in header' },
                        ],
                        options: [
                            { id: 'tab1', label: 'Tab1 in side menu' },
                            { id: 'tab2', label: 'Tab2 in side menu' },
                        ],
                    },
                    // Other sections...
                ],
            },
            // Other groups...
        ];
        ```
        
    *   [This declarative approach simplifies UI development and makes your code more predictable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-declarative)[1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-declarative).

Certainly! **React-declarative** provides its own way of handling state management in a declarative manner. Let‚Äôs explore how it achieves this:

1.  **State Management in React**:
    
    *   In React, state management is crucial for handling data that changes over time. Components can have local state (managed within the component) or global state (shared across components).

    *   Common approaches for state management include:
        *   **Local State**: Using `useState` or `this.state` within a component.
        *   **Context API**: For sharing state across components without prop drilling.
        *   **Redux**: A popular library for managing global state.
        *   **MobX**: Another library for state management.
        *   **Apollo Client**: For managing state in GraphQL applications.

    *   Each approach has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the complexity of your application and your preferences.

2.  **Declarative State Management in react-declarative**:
    
    *   React-declarative introduces its own way of managing state, emphasizing a declarative approach.
    *   The core concept is to define your state requirements declaratively, and the framework handles the rest.

    *   Here‚Äôs how it works:
        *   You define your state requirements using configuration objects.
        *   The framework generates the necessary components and manages their state.
        *   You interact with the generated components as needed.

    *   Example of declarative state management in react-declarative:
    
        ```tsx
        const options = [
            {
                id: 'build',
                label: 'Build',
                children: [
                    {
                        id: 'authentication',
                        label: 'Authentication',
                        isVisible: async () => await ioc.authService.hasRole('unauthorized'),
                        // Other properties...
                    },
                    // Other sections...
                ],
            },
            // Other groups...
        ];
        ```

    *   In this example, the `isVisible` property determines whether the ‚ÄúAuthentication‚Äù section should be visible based on the user‚Äôs role. The framework handles the state and rendering.

3.  **Benefits of Declarative State Management**:
    
    *   **Predictability**: Declarative state management simplifies your code and makes it more predictable. You express what you want, and the framework handles the implementation details.
    *   **Abstraction**: By abstracting away state management complexities, react-declarative allows you to focus on building UIs.
    *   **Efficiency**: The framework efficiently updates components when state changes, thanks to its declarative nature.

In summary, react-declarative handles state management by allowing you to express your state requirements declaratively, and it takes care of the underlying implementation. It‚Äôs an interesting alternative for those who prefer a declarative approach to state management in React applications! üòäüöÄ

            },
            // Other groups...
        ];
        ```

## How does react-declarative handle asynchronous state updates?

**React-declarative** handles asynchronous state updates in a way that aligns with its declarative philosophy. Let‚Äôs explore how it achieves this:

1.  **Declarative Approach to Asynchronous State**:
    
    *   React-declarative encourages you to express your state requirements declaratively, even when dealing with asynchronous updates.
    *   Instead of manually managing asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API), you define the desired outcome and let the framework handle the implementation details.

2.  **Example Scenario**:
    
    *   Imagine you have a component that needs to fetch user data from an API and display it. Here‚Äôs how react-declarative handles this:
    
        ```tsx
        const options = [
            {
                id: 'userProfile',
                label: 'User Profile',
                isVisible: true,
                async load: async () => {
                    // Simulate fetching user data from an API
                    const userData = await fetchUserData();
                    return userData;
                },
                render: (data) => {
                    // Render the user profile using the fetched data
                    return (
                    <div>
                        <h2>{data.name}</h2>
                        <p>Email: {data.email}</p>
                        {/* Other profile details */}
                    </div>
                    );
                },
            },
            // Other sections...
        ];
        ```
        
    *   In this example:
        *   The `load` function fetches user data asynchronously.
        *   The `render` function receives the fetched data and renders the user profile.
        *   You express the desired outcome (showing the user profile) without worrying about the API call details.

3.  **Benefits**:
    
    *   **Predictability**: By expressing your intent declaratively, you make your code more predictable.
    *   **Abstraction**: React-declarative abstracts away the complexities of handling asynchronous operations.
    *   **Efficiency**: The framework ensures that components update appropriately when data arrives.

4.  **Error Handling**:
    
    *   React-declarative also provides error handling mechanisms. For example, you can define an `onError` callback to handle errors during data fetching.

In summary, react-declarative simplifies asynchronous state management by allowing you to express your intent declaratively. It‚Äôs a powerful approach that aligns well with React‚Äôs core principles! üòäüöÄ
